Hi so can you like tell me where the crime rate is maximum?;
Okay.;
Ok so do the right one indicate the it is the hot spot?;
Okay. So do these red spots indicate that it is a hot spot of crime?;
okay got it.;
Okay. So which is the safest area according to you?;
Okay.;
That is great.;
What is this area called?;
I mean I am not familiar with the map that much so.;
So according to my understanding I think the West Randolph Street has the maximum crime rate and I guess somewhere near Pearson Street the crime rate is maximum.;
Well and it is uniformly distributed all over so.;
So during what time is the crime rate maximum?;
Ok. So the crime rate is maximum between 12 noon and 6 PM.;
That is surprising.;
Ok.;
Good.;
So according to you which areas do I deploy the officers?;
Ok so the crime on the streets is the maximum.;
So ideally I would think we should be deploying more officers near River North and maybe near UIC and Near West.;
Ok.;
Ok well the response is great.;
So what kind of crime is what what kind of crime is maximum?;
Ok.;
So according to you theft is the maximum the biggest crime.;
So I think that we should be deploying the officers near River North?;
Ok.;
So which month has the maximum number of theft? Or any other crime?;
Ok.;
So June and July have the maximum number of crimes and the least number of crime are in February.;
alright.;
alright.;
Yes the response is quite good.;
Ok.;
So according to your analysis at what point in the day is the crime rate maximum? I mean the time is it 3 oclock 4 oclock?;
Ok ok so the maximum number of crimes happen during the 12 noon?;
Ok so it is basically between 12 to 8 PM?;
Ok.;
Ok.;
This is great. The response is great.;
So how many crimes have occurred at a particular residence or residential area?;
Ok so around 13000 crimes occur in residences.;
Ok.;
The response is good.;
So are there any incidence happening on the CTA train?;
Ok.;
Ok so approximately 3000 number of incidence have occurred on the CTA train.;
Wow ok.;
Ok.;
;
So is there any particular location where the crime keep on repeating?;
Ok.;
I mean to say that is there a particular hot spot where the crimes keep on happening. The same kind of crime keeps on happening at a different point of time but the activity keep on happening.;
Ok so somewhere near the River North and the Loop the incidence keeps on repeating and and during 2011 it it is more or less the same place.;
Ok so according to my analysis the crime is happening the maximum crimes is happening at around the same location.;
Ok.;
Yes the response was good.;
So according to you is the crime rate increasing for you or decreasing?;
Ok so the crime is decreasing.;
So can you give me the statistics of the number of officers deployed?;
Alright.;
So are there any cases of human trafficking?;
Ok so from my understanding there is none.;
Ok.;
So how many crimes have occurred on the lakefront or the River Bank?;
Ok so is this statistics from all 5 years? Or is this for a particular year?;
Ok.;
Ok.;
Ok so again the maximum crime is happening around the Randolph;
Ok.;
And at other places it is more or less uniformly distributed.;
Ok.;
So can you tell me the the day of the week where the crime is maximum?;
Ok.;
So the maximum number of crimes occur during weekends.;
Ok.;
Yes the response is great.;
Ok so tell me how many kidnapping cases have been registered in the last 4 years?;
Ok so the maximum number of kidnappings happened in 2012.;
Ok and in 2014 they were released.;
Ok.;
Yes this response is good.;
So can you tell me the biggest crime happening in UIC?;
Ok again here theft is the maximum crime.;
Ok.;
Ok.;
So is there any particular location on UIC where the crime is maximum?;
Ok so the maximum number of crimes are occurring somewhere around the Canal Street?;
And there are a few incidence on Roosevelt.;
Ok.;
That is great.;
So are there any break ins near UIC?;
Ok. So the break ins are maximum somewhere around Ogden and the University Village.;
Ok.;
Ok the response is good.;
So are there any cases of murder or attempted murders?;
Ok so is this map providing me all statistics from all 4 years?;
Ok.;
Ok so the maximum number of incidences have occurred somewhere south of Roosevelt and Racine.;
Ok.;
Fine so are there any incidence happening in and around schools and universities?;
Ok.;
Ok.;
The response is good.;
Alright.;
So among all these crimes is there a a particular crime that is negligible?;
Ok so what kind of crime is the the least seen? The one that is negligible.;
Ok ok.;
Alright alright.;
So what is which type of crime is the least seen?;
Ok.;
Ok so what do you mean by non criminal?;
Ok so is there any particular crime that is on the rise?;
Ok I did not get any response.;
Yeah so basically everything is decreasing.;
I can see that the deceptive practice has increased a little.;
Ok.;
Ok. The response is good.;
So you know I think I have asked all possible kinds of questions;
Let is see.;
I should probably look at let us start with the activity around UIC?;
;
Let is see.;
Is is it working? Is it moving?;
It is probably;
Just saying out my thoughts.;
It is processing so it is working.;
This thing is all sorting so.;
Let is see city is specifically aiming to deploy additional law enforcement resources to and deter crime and need to know which areas to deploy the officers.;
That is all neighborhoods this is specifically just UIC.;
I am looking at Canal and Roosevelt.;
That one is really hot!;
Wait what what metro is that? That one right there. That one is really really red. I can not see with the dots in the way though. What metro is that?;
It is not neighborhoods.;
Is it Jackson Boulevard?;
Let is see can I alter this ok.;
yeah I want to take a look closer to the metro right here a little bit eastward of Greektown.;
That is like right by the river.;
you can not zoom in.;
Ok that is fine.;
Alright cool because that is a funky spot.;
Crime is right there at the metro.;
I think I got this one for UIC where to deploy officers would be around the perimeter this looks like East Campus.;
Yeah.;
I think.;
Thank you.;
Alright then let us take a look I am curious about River North? The activity around River North and in it?;
Yes.;
it is shrinking!;
This is so cool look at it go.;
Goodbye adult maps you have b baby maps.;
That one is a teenager.;
Alright.;
;
it is the dot is are not as red but it is definitely red around Chicago Avenue.;
So it is more focused around there not surprised since that is like shopping and everything.;
So nice place to break in stuff I guess.;
Often very populated so I am not sure who has the guts to go doing that.;
Except let us see I spent an all nighter once.;
But around 4 AM no.;
So for UIC I am saying we do the perimeter for River North we would do a Loop within it over here it seems we go along State because that is where it is concentrated yeah.;
Well that was a lot quicker than I thought ok.;
let me see the activity for Near West Side.;
I feel so official this is great!;
Let is see.;
I have to look at crime types later.;
What street is that? that is Damen! I drove through Damen!;
Ok so I can probably see the setting.;
Setting that looks very deteriorated I will say.;
but we got a problem up on this line a problem up on that line.;
The one up on West Division and the one up on the 64 it looks like.;
And then we got everything around it is pink and then we got red dot.;
Wonder what happened might have to look at the details.;
this is bad.;
I wonder if I could look at just the general type of crime that occurs in Near West.;
I could.;
That might make my decision a lot better because this one is more spaced out.;
So I will look at that later.;
;
Ok.;
From this angle if I just using Keller theory I should be on the money with UIC.;
Is that what deceptive practice ok.;
Ask the in room aid alright.;
Hi when it says deceptive practice are we talking fraud?;
Ok so the Loop has fraud problems ok.;
So Near West I would conclude that we would do hold on.;
There is information for time of the year for deployment. Could I take a look at when crimes happen?;
nice.;
And then I continue looking around here.;
There is a diamond there but what happens there that West side of Near West that needs help. Yeah. Definitely a G there.;
Significant changes in crime patterns.;
Are we talking like different settings?;
;
Hello! Ok this spot where it says that significant changes in crime patterns are we talking more like changes due to crime setting or changes over time?;
We are looking at number of crimes per year in all neighborhoods by per month.;
but there is definitely a time when when the when children almost everyone who is pursuing goes back to and then if I am talking more of the family unit parents are at work children are at school around that time or getting ready so houses get broken?;
Because like number of crimes a lot of these would account for theft so I am assuming a lot of these are for theft. Unless I could look at them by different crime types.;
Like individually like because I know theft is going to be big.;
I am starting to think I got the routes West side I do.;
I got to look at the other ones later.;
But I want to determine on times of day theft happens a lot from what the other graphs say.;
So I am wondering if the top purple line is theft because then it will match the information on the other graphs but I am not always sure?;
Because like what is no a lot of these colors are similar or the same.;
That might be troublesome.;
Because like I was kind of interpreting that the fraud was like so high that everybody was doing it.;
I mean I know I did it as a kid.;
there we go. That helps a lot better.;
So it was not the sex offense it was the criminal damage.;
Yeah labeling definitely does help yes ok.;
gambling.;
Got to find spikes that is why the 9 AM was so weird for me because spikes.;
Let me do the last two ok done.;
That is great.;
I I will have labels now. Thank you.;
This is very helpful.;
Ok so I do not really need the year anymore because from the looks of it we are doing something right and it is heading down.;
Just hoping that 2015 does not spike because you know graphs numbers weird.;
And I I got the G pattern I got for Near West.;
So let me see the what kind of crimes happen around UIC. That map.;
Because I am done with the year I think I am done with the time so.;
Ok. Whoo it is bigger!;
Alright. So is this the one you mean?;
this is really helpful because I need to but it is much like I was doing with West Side I would like the crime types with the crime activity.;
Yep.;
Thank you.;
It is a ball bouncing.;
Interference with public officer ok.;
Excuse me.;
Ok theft and burglary is burglary like more of the whole with trespassing?;
And theft is like more aggressive force or something?;
Because I had just noticed that.;
Does not change too much atleast.;
I just UIC.;
Could I have like a hot spot map like kind of like that colorful one for Near West side with the blue dots too?;
Thank you I shall take a look at these by the hour.;
Ok still on the weekends and I would still assume summer months because that is when everyone is out.;
Yep.;
could I take a look at 10-3?;
So if I wanted to deploy officers it it almost seems like the whole city needs to be watched over for weekend patrol.;
Ok so can I see the total number of crimes by type? like type of crime along the x-axis and total number on the y?;
Or some other representation.;
So there is clearly a lot of theft and battery.;
Sorry could you make it a little smaller?;
Yeah deceptive practice I do not know what that is.;
Ok so I guess I am kind of seeing maybe five categories theft battery whatever I do not know what the second thing is yeah.;
Ok now can I see the number of crimes by location type?;
Ok and do we have a map of where the crimes occurred in those neighborhoods?;
Ok number of crimes ok.;
So can I can I filter crimes on the map to just show theft?;
Does not do too much for me I guess theft is just everywhere.;
How how about another map with just battery?;
Ok definitely more battery in Lincoln Park.;
ok how about I guess I am thinking they want to know where battery is pretty serious so I want to focus on battery for a sec.;
So can I see battery crimes by by by how about by day?;
Does that does by day mean by day of week?;
By day of week?;
yeah I guess I would like to see battery well I would like to see battery by day of week battery by month and battery by year.;
Three different terms.;
So during the summer weekends.;
Yes that response is ok.;
Ok so if we have data for these different neighborhoods could I see neighborhood totals? So could I see total number of batteries by neighborhood?;
Ok let us that to total number of thefts by neighborhood and total number of crimes by neighborhood.;
ok so that is interesting so the Loop is it possible to make the y-axis of those same graphs the same scale?;
So I yeah.;
I know battery is going to be like.;
ok so we have a lot of theft in River North and the Loop.;
Ok so I guess now I am Ok.;
Ok so now can I see crime by location in River North?;
So I want to know where all this theft is happening.;
And by location department store that is interesting.;
ok how about just because im curious about theft in department stores by neighborhood.;
ok I guess that makes sense.;
Ok.;
So I kind definitely getting like the big picture.;
I am wondering if all I mean I am sure all crime goes down in the winter and over the week but it would be interesting to see if could I see let us see number of crimes by type in December January and February and then number of crimes by type for June July and August?;
Is that possible?;
so one chart showing December January and February with crimes by type of crime by count yeah.;
and the other what did I say June July and August.;
Ok so that did not really do anything.;
I guess that is surprising sorry I am walking over here.;
can correcting error ok.;
I guess I was just looking at.;
So I guess I was assuming earlier that all crime goes up in the just to confirm that assumption could I see total crime by month thank you?;
Yeah it looks like the type of crime does.;
sorry.;
Yeah ok so yeah make that bigger.;
So I guess I am looking at differences between these two and there are not many but it looks like well can I see criminal trespassing by month?;
It is weird that it would be higher in the winter.;
Well I guess maybe it is because they are arresting homeless people.;
that is interesting. Wonder that is weird. Ok.;
How well.;
Let is see there is other things I was thinking about.;
How about criminal trespassing by or yeah neighborhood.;
Ok what about this.;
Earlier did did one of these it it was like split up by type of crime maybe like make this smaller.;
Yeah this one.;
Yeah so could could I ok so this is crimes types by neighborhood for one year.;
Could I see crime type by neighborhood for three month periods? So crime types by neighborhood January February March. And then crime types by neighborhood April May June. And then crime types by neighborhood July August September.;
Is that possible?;
and then October November December yeah.;
yeah so January Feburary March April May June July August September October November December. So three month chunks yeah.;
That makes Ok.;
One two which.;
Ok so.;
could could you stack them? So January is at the top and you can make them smaller too if you need to.;
Yeah.;
And how many years is this over? Like all the data it is like four years?;
2010 to 2014. Ok so this is four years worth of data and.;
Ok well now I I am still interested in this criminal trespassing.;
Could I see criminal trespassing by month by neighborhood?;
trespassing in River North that is weird.;
weird a lot of trespassing it is over here in where did that go?;
here.;
here.;
;
yeah so this is location type and names right?;
no problem.;
So this is kind of interesting.;
This yeah.;
So in The Loop they are kicking people out of resturants.;
Weird parking lots in River North I wonder what that is about.;
Ok how about trespassing criminal trespassing in parking lots in River North by month?;
cause that is a really big parking lot.;
I had location.;
What was yeah this can you make this bigger?;
The location type and name yeah.;
That is what started this whole thing the parking lots and resturants.;
That is crazy ok.;
Well there is something for my boss.;
I I guess that is Depaul or something.;
Theft.;
Yeah I guess the same thing but theft by location type and neighborhood.;
Theft by like yeah this one.;
So people are trespassing in parking lots in River North and stealing things off the street in Near West Side and robbing department stores yeah ok.;
let us view what about ok I like these two could I also see robbery by location type and neighborhood?;
I guess I am just thinking that robbery is scarier than theft.;
Robbery by location type and neighborhood yeah.;
ok how about let me think.;
Ok one crime by location type in River North and one crime by location type in the Near West Side.;
the Near West Side crime by location type.;
that is a big chart.;
yeah I guess that is what I asked for.;
Can I can I filter to the top?;
How about let me think.;
no problem.;
Reminds me of criminal trespassing.;
maybe just you can close these yeah I do not know if I am I should be asking to close stuff or not.;
ok how about never location just total type of crime in River North and the Near West Side.;
ok.;
Now let us look so this looks like here.;
So I guess the theft ok can I see thanks yeah that was actually what I was going to ask for.;
where.;
Could I what do I want to see how again in Near West and theft by location type.;
And I guess I am I am wondering because there is two colors there to tell what is long on.;
So who cares about this one.;
Ok I guess that is obviously.;
It would be nice if there were labels just for that and location type.;
sorry ok.;
Yes can I see the well I guess that is a good question.;
yeah River North and Near West theft by location type I mean proportionaly.;
Yeah.;
And I it would be nice if it were like ranked so the biggest were at the top or something.;
What?;
yeah.;
So that is a could you move it over just a little bit to the right?;
Yeah thanks.;
yeah ok.;
Can I like save that? Or put it over there?;
ok let us see.;
How much time do I have left?;
let us see How;
What restaurant should I be avoiding past 10 PM on an average Friday night?;
it seems like River North is the place where I would not want to go eat at 9 PM just because of the the number of crimes overall.;
Ok some number of crimes.;
Now you see the map is a little too clustered is it possible to just see the number of all the data points with more than fifty crimes in the area?;
Yes is it possible to see only the spots with more than 50 crimes?;
Some number of crimes?;
Seems yeah it seems like the street running parallel to Michigan which I have no idea I can not see.;
Can you move it to the left a little bit the divider is cutting it off?;
Thank you.;
State street ok.;
State street seems to be the one I want to avoid at night for a restaurant period ok.;
Can I also get a breakdown of the number of crimes in River North for only the last four weeks?;
Cool so this is for a month November 20th to December 20th ok so theft is the most prevalent crime from what I can see you might still get away with your life.;
interesting can I see labels on the data please?;
Interesting three prostitution cases three liquor law violations one homicide.;
Can I also see where exactly these prostitution crimes occurred?;
Cool so it is within a block and a half.;
Grand and Michigan seems to be the the central point or actually Michigan and Ontario interesting.;
Can I see the number of prostitution cases within a three block radius around Ontario and Michigan for prostitution cases?;
Interesting so yeah it does seem to be pretty concentrated around that area but we do not have the rest from reference.;
Can I also see the rest of the cases in River North for prostitution?;
Ok cool can I see all the cases in all four locations?;
wow so it is mostly in that area interesting that is a pretty interesting hub for prostitution.;
and now on Madison Street Madison Monroe that is interesting that is where I live.;
ok now if I were to go to a restaurant on Valentines day and if I were to drive there what parking lot should I avoid based on the number of crimes on the day?;
Absolutely if I were to drive to a restaurant in Chicago in one of these four areas which restaurants should I which parking lots should I be avoiding based on the number of crimes in the lot?;
Very cool;
February 1st February 15th interesting so that one right there not going there Fullerton and Fulton and what is that Western?;
Now is this any different from the rest the rest the days on average?;
Sorry.;
Can we normalize the data?;
Ok ok.;
Now for the for the crimes in parking lots can I also see the major restaurants around them?;
That is fine Friday.;
Yeah very difficult to extract anything from this ok.;
Which areas have the highest number of deceptive practices when it to retail stores?;
Ok that is fine thank you.;
Can I see robberies batteries and thefts in in the UIC area for the last year separately please?;
Robberies UIC 2014.;
Ok.;
There and what is the sum number of robberies in the UIC area?;
Wow Roosevelt and Canal?;
Really want to avoid that part.;
Madison and Western interesting I would not expect that.;
Yeah Roosevelt street notorious. Jackson boulevard for batteries.;
wow this is just for 2014? Damn criminal damage wow.;
Now how many of these thefts were on a sidewalk as opposed to an alleyway?;
A lot of battery cases criminal damage deceptive practice.;
Alright so most of them are just plain old street grocery food store.;
Now is this inside a grocery food store or outside?;
Ok wow interesting parking lots.;
Where did these parking lot offenses occur?;
CTA Train CTA Bus yikes.;
Parking lot and grounds.;
The one on Roosevelt and what is this Canal is the one to avoid.;
Could you move this a little up please?;
Thank you.;
And around Greek Town eureka.;
Greek Town is can we also so it is about eleven crimes.;
I see few far out.;
For the CTA bus and CTA train offenses can we get a breakdown according to the time of day?;
Data type oops sorry.;
Sidewalks theft interesting.;
Wow this is kind of insane.;
Are you ready for the next one?;
;
wow ok.;
this is all CTA train instances in 2014.;
Number of crimes wow.;
So can we also get a breakdown of the type of crimes for 10 AM? Yes.;
So this is hours of the day all crimes interesting.;
Yeah so the can we also get the so 19 23 so yeah this is the pushing up the results just because of deceptive practices around that time interesting.;
Can we get data labels on each of the breakdowns?;
Thank you.;
That is all and this is all but deceptive.;
Pink CTA platform that means ok so this is probably people up to you and saying that I need some money for the bus.;
Public indecency what is that?;
Is that would it also mean being drunk in public public indecency?;
Can we see just the public I am sorry yeah the public indecencies?;
Ok that is interesting.;
I this makes more sense though besides the deceptive practices. What else is there deceptive practice.;
Ok CTA garage.;
So past 12 noon can we map the rest of the data somehow?;
Can I see the absolutely.;
1-16. Past 12 noon ok.;
Can we get them past 6 PM?;
By Roosevelt and no what is Ashland.;
I am sorry yeah is not that the worst?;
Roosevelt and Canal.;
Yeah that does not seem to be a good intersection overall either.;
Let me see Harrison.;
Greektown area is yeah Roosevelt and Canal Greektown damn.;
Yeah Greektown is not safe not one spot.;
a lot of it is around Roosevelt is not it.;
Past 6 PM.;
Can we because that is just CTA locations.;
Can we see all the the crimes for the same past 6 PM?;
ok can we take out deceptive practices from this?;
Yeah that happens all the time around the area so I know.;
fairly stimulus though.;
It is Roosevelt right it is always Roosevelt and Canal all of them.;
But then again this is ok.;
Can we see just homicides for this one?;
I would like to see that.;
I think that is a proper that is that is a brutal end.;
It is pretty awesome though it really is.;
Well that is not bad at all just two in 2014.;
alright so show me the the months where the most number of crimes occur around school areas.;
Yes.;
What question would you like to answer?;
Yes here is ok I will think out loud.;
I am thinking that the schools are in in session from a certain number of months in during the year and then the schools are out of session for some certain number of months during the year.;
And I am wondering if the crime scene changes around those schools in session month and the school out of session month and which crimes are more prevalent when school is in session and when school is out of session.;
It says crime type and month of year looks like.;
Oh yeah that is much more helpful.;
Ok so this is interesting.;
So there is no age related data here so.;
It is ok that is ok.;
so the biggest crimes the most number of crimes are theft.;
And they seem to go up during July and August.;
And a little bit a little bit of a blip in January.;
In the beginning of January it is probably Christmas.;
;
So can we narrow in on June to September theft data and where it is happening?;
ok.;
So most of it is happening at streets restaurants.;
What is the difference between a street and a sidewalk for theft?;
so street could include people robbing from cars breaking into cars.;
So is there a time of day when the or time of day when the street theft from June to September is is happening more frequently?;
What is the time of day look like for that street data?;
That is really interesting.;
So is there a way to show how many officers were on these particular streets here where it looks like most of these;
well first of all tell me if I am reading these correctly.;
So the numbers of crimes by hours are kind of the six hour segments are overlaid with these red dots and the darker the red the more is where the higher concentration is of crime.;
ok.;
So if the theory is that we need one of the hypotheses is that we need more officers on the street we would need to figure out how many officers were or are not typically on the streets between 12 noon and 12 midnight.;
and let us just say we pick this area here just north and West of Grant Park around Randolph.;
Ok no that that is fine.;
to go down that thesis path we would need to know what we had as a baseline because there may be no officers in which case yeah it makes sense to put them on streets between 12 noon and 12 midnight.;
So by year this is interesting so we are only looking at one year here.;
Are there other years that we can look at this exact same picture?;
This is all four years 2010 to 2014 ok.;
Ok let us can we do that same picture of data that we just did for crimes could we do it I mean for theft can we do it for battery?;
This there is a lot going on in this picture here.;
Ok so battery really dropped from 12 midnight to 6 AM between 2010 and 2011.;
What can we infer about what was happening to make that drop happen?;
Do we have data that tells us anything about that?;
Overall there is a few of them that are trending upward between 2013 and 2014.;
So maybe we pick an area well first can we pick one of an actual location and look at the I mean the time around that particular location?;
Ok great so let us pick this big red dot over here.;
very good.;
Let is see it looks like it is Madison and State and Madison right there.;
There is two big red dots there.;
State and Madison and then State I guess it is Lake.;
it is State and Washington.;
State and Washington State and Madison.;
Ok so what are these colors telling me?;
There is a lot of.;
Yes you have got the location absolutely.;
But there is two hot spots right there.;
Those two dark red spots where it looks like there is a real concentration.;
I guess my question is what is what is at those two bright red spots?;
What is there?;
Yes number of crimes.;
I guess I am looking for what buildings are there?;
Or if it is an EL stop or something?;
Those two big red spots let us take a year by year picture of the crime data that is happening in those two spots.;
Ok so can we now look at that purple line for theft in that hot spot on a month to month basis?;
So could we do like an overlay of 2010 January to December with the next few years so we see if like there is a change from year to year across the months in theft?;
So if we had to just make one inference right now from this data based on those two spots it looks like some time around October to running up to the new year the crimes in those in that really the big hot spot it is making that hot spot that red because of theft and most of that theft is happening from October to late December.;
Is that a fair inference?;
So I guess if I had data now on how many officers were on the streets during that period from October to December I would probably double check to see where those officers were and whether they were walking or in cars and why the streets felt like they could be why people on the streets felt like they could be robbed or looked like they could be robbed.;
But I would look at that data cause those are the two biggest hot spots there.;
I suppose the next thing we could do is look at the other hot spot that you had for crimes which is up in the North side if that is the zero the the the 12-1.PNG.;
That is the number of crimes that are all the crimes.;
But now let us see.;
Do we have more time to do one more?;
Hooray.;
Ok great.;
Alright so let us see what we can find out about Chicago Avenue it is just off of Michigan so like right right it is like Chicago Michigan right there.;
Magnificent mile.;
It is interesting they break out robbery versus I guess robbery means they had to break in or something.;
Ok so it is still theft.;
Theft and deceptive practice.;
So we you in your thing it describes where the crime occurred?;
Like where it occurs on a parking lot or the lake front or the convenience store.;
Is there a way to show that data for one of these months?;
cool.;
Alright let us pick a month.;
hot spot November yep and then let us find out where what the location type was of the thefts.;
And you can do it by year or you can lump them all together either one works for me.;
Alright.;
Well that would explain why in crime spot number one which is mostly right there near the the downtown shopping areas and also crime spot number 2.;
That so this is not so much person on person crime as it is person from store crime.;
Is that what the inference that you would draw from that?;
This is not like like you reaching into my wallet I mean my purse and taking my wallet this is you know you go in to a department store picking up a pair of sunglasses and walking out.;
That is theft right?;
Homicide.;
That is what they are focussed on.;
And that barely that barely even was a blip on our picture.;
Let is bring back up our all our crimes the crime type and then yeah that one that one yep that one 06-3.PNG that is a good one.;
homicide a brown line it is hard to even see.;
But maybe we should take homicide to battery.;
Take out theft and just do homicide to battery put them on put them in the same picture and see who pops up.;
So then we will have a zero to 6k scale and we will see a little more of a;
Ok thanks.;
Haha look at that.;
Look at the correlation between homicide and battery.;
You know like what areas and and what location type.;
Yeah yes I will form that as a question.;
let us look at the years 2011 to 2013 for homicide and look at the location type where the crimes occurred.;
Ok so street apartment.;
Those are where the most of these are happening the homicide in the region for those months.;
So so you can take or can you take these two pieces of data the street and apartment for 2011 to 2013 and show them on the map?;
;
So what kind of data can you show me about this bright red dot right here?;
It is looks like it is just north of Lake.;
what would that street be?;
That is do not know what that street is maybe;
No it can not be.;
What is causing these little white out squares?;
yeah so 2011.;
We do not we would have to do another map to figure out when each of those or what year each of those homicides took place.;
I know what let us do.;
Let is do that same this year 14.PNG.;
Let is just do that just for 2012 when we had this spike.;
I could just start out with the question could I guess just a general one like could I get the information for the UIC crime statistics.;
Is that like too general?;
Should I wait for each question? Like could you ask multiple questions?;
Is is this by a specific year?;
So it is 2010 2002 Ok.;
So each plot is for 2010 to 2014 or each one is a year?;
So UIC day of the week.;
Number of crime.;
Is there could you get this information by type of crime?;
ok location and then type.;
So street theft is very high.;
Seems like crime is going down since 2010.;
I know this is a lot this is a lot of stuff but is there any way to keep all of this up while we look at another neighborhood?;
I am tryin is there a list of the so River North.;
Could I look at River North?;
I guess the same the same graphs that you gave me.;
Or if you could minimize the UIC I guess that would be fine too if I could still bring them up.;
I do not know if you could do that.;
Actually if you could if you could make I guess the GPS map a little bit bigger?;
That would be good thanks.;
I do not know where we are.;
Alright.;
So I guess I still need to the GPS maps for the other neighborhoods but just looking at it looks like there is a relatively as far as the entire neighborhood there is a relatively low amount of crime but there is a certain I guess they would call this hot spots of crime where they are the red dots so signifies there there a lot more.;
I guess I do not know if that is Canal or maybe it is Canal street or something.;
Is there any way to to be able to to better read the street names on the GPS map?;
Ok.;
it do not look like Michigan.;
Is there any way that I could take notes on these things?;
can you bring up the the graph behind the 02-2 River North one?;
Thanks.;
So that is.;
Ok right now I am just taking notes for myself on just what I see to be the highest accounts of of number of crimes day of the week hour of the day just so I have a list for myself.;
Can you bring up 02-5 and 02-4 no yeah and 02-2?;
is there a graph for just number of crimes just in total for for all four neighborhoods?;
Ok is there a way to minimize these like take them of the screen?;
That would be good or we could get rid of them and put in put in the next two neighborhoods.;
I guess that is Canal Street.;
There is also a few in seems kind of kind of scattered like there is a dot kind of all around the UIC neighborhood so there is a not really any like I guess there is a slight safe areas but anyways just talking out loud.;
could you do the same thing yeah to the River North?;
ok.;
So Sedgewich.;
There is one around I actually do not know.;
I guess that is around Chicago and Ontario.;
Some around Division and yeah Chicago area.;
Around Pearson.;
Seems like going towards the lake.;
There is a lot less.;
Actually going the furthest East and West of the neighborhood there is less of a chance of crime it seems.;
It is more centrally located which kind of makes sense.;
I guess North too.;
Is Near West like Lincoln Park or is that?;
Just curious what Near West means.;
And there is Near West.;
Is there a map for the Loop?;
River North.;
Could you bring back the one behind it real quick?;
thanks.;
Ok so Near West.;
is there graphs for day of the week for Near West and Loop?;
Could I have have all of the maps kind of central together so I can;
Ok so it seems River North and I guess I am just wondering right now why because that map for number of crimes for all neighborhoods has the Loop the least amount of crimes but then this map has it on a scale up to 1942 but the others like UIC and Near West are just 654 and 824 though they are supposed to have more crimes.;
Alright so the Loop the Loop has the least number of crimes for that period but for one I guess kind of hot spot they have they have more than the others so.;
;
Could you could you maximize the the Loop map?;
So that is State Street.;
and then maximize the Near West.;
Damen.;
Damen.;
Alright.;
And could could you put them all side by side again?;
could I see all four maps for the crime type side by side?;
;
Ok this is good.;
so right now before I was looking at just the highest occurrence for each neighborhood each crime type but now since I think that law enforcement would be interested in I am not not saying that theft that theft and battery are not serious but maybe they would be interested in burglary homicide sex offenses.;
So I guess if we are talking about like deployment for that specific kind of crime and they maybe want to focus on those two.;
Alright could you move 08 a little bit?;
Ok.;
So the task so was given to me is the city is specifically aiming to deploy additional law enforcement resources to deter crime.;
Yeah well what I wrote down I mean anyways for yeah for Near West and UIC it is the same like the summer has.;
It is really high instances so but if I if I could back to the task list.;
to move to move 08.;
So yeah it is kind of interesting in answering these questions both generally and specifically.;
;
If I mean if I am looking at you know whether to deploy additional law enforcement then I would say during the summer but I feel like that is kind of an like an obvious answer just because I think we know that crime happens more in the summer.;
;
If we are looking at?;
Let me see a month day of the week.;
So do I like ask for a map or how does this work?;
well I guess can we see the can we see the map?;
Please?;
Let is see.;
Actually as soon as you get the map up when everything is all up and loaded can can you load all of the data?;
Just so we have like a big aggregate to see kind of what we are working with?;
And then let us see I do not know what the the specs are but once we have the this is mostly me thinking out loud but maybe if we can see kind of a temporal either a bar chart or something?;
there we go not a bar chart like a line graph just to get kind of a sense of what is happening.;
wow that is a lot of crimes.;
and then crime types wow.;
can let us can we just look at what is it River North and area atleast?;
Just to narrow that down it seems like the most high density crimes.;
Data Analysis expert is there anyway to get an idea of where these peaks and this number of crimes per month were like what month they are falling on? If there is any kind of trend in that?;
It is like periodic that is weird.;
And then.;
Let is see.;
So that is the 290 right? I think.;
One more request for you when you get the chance.;
awesome.;
perfect!;
Actually could you bring the one you just moved?;
Yeah right there is perfect.;
August summer time.;
Why is it summer time that there is always like lots of violence?;
I do not get it.;
You would think everybody is like really hot they would not want to move around and kill each other but go figure.;
so can we filter the map just on the months of like I do not know June July and August?;
Or not the maps but filter the data.;
So just describe this chart so we got a bar chart with the number of crimes aggregated by months.;
It is the love month right?;
what is this map for?;
Or what is the difference between 4 and 3-2.PNG?;
;
Right on thank you.;
I do not know what I was expecting I thought it would be different.;
Ok can we start with do we have can we look at like time of day for for this time period for June July and August?.;
That is kind of a general request;
So Ok so here is just a map.;
It is just showing the overall crimes for just the months of June July and August it is looks almost identical to the total aggregate data which is kind of telling.;
So afternoon to 12 midnight is really popular.;
can we see crime at hour wait 12 noon?;
At least to start?;
Yeah can we just look at all the crimes that occur at 12 o clock noon?;
Theft.;
I have a request.;
So how about another bar chart just showing the number of crimes by crime type on the x-axis for June July August just at 12 noon.;
With overwhelmingly so is theft is just the biggest one?;
can;
Weird.;
ok how so let us look at some 12 noon to 6 PM block in terms of crime.;
Over whelmingly.;
Ok well clearly they need to stop people from stealing stuff.;
can we just focus on what is the Loop and River North for this data? like a hot spot map like this but just of thefts?;
Ok number of crimes Loop and River North.;
I do not know how officers target theft but make people stop stealing.;
And atleast in those areas.;
Can is there anyway you can filter hotspots within the map?;
So within River North and and the Loop there is I do not know one two there is like six like really dark red like I am curious what is going on there.;
and then can we get just the the crime types for these areas?;
So we have got this map but just filter you are awesome so good at this.;
Ok so this;
By crime type from 2010 to 2014 for June July August for 12 noon just hot spots.;
;
sorry.;
So it is just I do not know saying you are going to sell something when really when really it is something different?;
Or whatever?;
I think I already have my answer but just to be thorough can we have the 12 noon to 6 PM?;
For this spot?;
For this area?;
Yeah that is what I figured.;
so this is just another bar chart showing number of crimes by crime type for the month of dates 2010 to 2014 for June July August from 12 noon to 6 PM just to the hot spots that I requested.;
Did I I do not think I asked days of the week did I?;
could we see between 12 noon and 6 PM within this zone like days of the week?;
Maybe try and rephrase that in no you got it.;
That would be kind of a fun visualization to just watch like how like the crimes occur over like the hours of the day or something I do not know.;
Crime does not take a vacation what the hell yeah.;
Ok I have a new request.;
can we look at the whole city map? like a hot spot map like this but just of thefts?;
And yeah.;
And then when you have time can we get like a line graph? A temporal line graph showing just the rate of aggregated rate of thefts you know covers like the months through 2010 to 2014?;
So responsive I love it.;
Got it sure done.;
ok so we have got 2 line charts they are both on a like a temporal temporal visualization.;
Both are showing the number of crimes per month from 2010 to 2014.;
That is so good though like crime has like totally dropped off.;
Could we could we see like weather patterns?;
Like what the temperature over the last like 10 years is?;
June July August right right ok.;
Let is can we go back to that map that just shows like all the crimes for the whole time period?;
I think it is like that one right there or maybe it is that one I do not remember yeah that one perfect.;
Did you show me the number of crimes like just aggregate number of crime like one of these bar charts?;
Great thank you.;
To be honest I was a little disappointed by the types of crimes I was really hoping there would be like lots of murder and drugs and stuff but that is just good.;
So the number of crimes per month from 2010 to 2014?;
Can I manipulate can I touch the wall?;
Is that Ok?;
I feel like I am in a center now you know like Minority Report?;
And then while you you are generating that graph can we get a map of just the battery?;
the aggregated total batteries?;
So that is theft crime battery.;
And and when you get a chance I realize you are working can you get can I get a labeled map of the battery?;
Deceptive practice that is funny.;
Not nearly as many crimes as thefts but we can be happy for that I think.;
Ok awesome.;
you you actually you can close out all of the theft charts if you want just save space or what not.;
I do not care about theft anymore.;
Battery only.;
Can we look at the the days of the just like an aggregated days of the week bar chart.;
and another bar chart of like hours of the day?;
And one of the like top months?;
If that makes sense?;
It is a lot of requests I realize.;
yeah when you are done moving stuff around can you bring back the battery chart or battery map?;
Thanks.;
January.;
Awesome.;
Is this is number of crimes for days of the week for battery only? Or is it for all crimes?;
Oh oh good to know.;
could I get these same charts but just for battery?;
You do not have any information about like alcohol use do you?;
Ok how about alcohol use and narcotics can I get yeah so can I get a map of just the drug use? So aggregated drug use for all the months?;
And aggregated drug use for all the days?;
Sunday and Saturday are not what I thought they would be.;
Do we know what types of drugs? Do we have information on like the specific type of narcotic?;
No?;
Ok.;
Cause there is like you know like ecstasy for instance the they call it the suicide drug cause you take it on like Friday and you suicide on Tuesday because you like all the chemical freak outs that go through your body was wondering you see could see something like you do lots of alcohol on Friday they start beating beating people a lot on Saturday and Sunday because of the ha;
Battery per the months Days of the week.;
ok.;
For going back to the battery can we just look at can we look at like a temporal scale of Sunday and Saturday across all the years for each of the months?;
;
Can I get this this temporal graph can I get it labeled for the months please?;
And then just describe it it is just a line chart from 2010 to 2015 for the number of crimes per month just the battery on Saturday and Sunday only.;
can you split this Saturday and Sunday chart so just have like have two like a dual line line graph line chart one showing just Saturdays only and the other one showing Sundays only?;
Awesome.;
can we just look at this period of June July and August in 2014 of batteries on Sundays?;
In particular?;
Actually add Saturday.;
You can make a separate chart with Saturdays as well;
We have no information about like socioeconomic status do we?;
How about race information?;
Nope?;
Ok.;
right.;
so this is a beautiful chart showing two lines one for Sunday one for Saturday showing the number of crimes per month from 2010 to 2014 just of battery. It is a labeled chart very nice.;
Sunday seems to be the most popular day to beat people up with Saturday sprinkled in there.;
Interesting.;
It just gets worse.;
Why?;
;
finally can we do a like a just showing an area map of like Saturday and Sundays for batteries?;
and then this is just a graph of well it is a line graph for the months of June July and August showing from 2010 to 2014. No no no just of 2014 for Saturdays and Sundays only in this case it is just for Sunday and there is another chart for just Saturday.;
ok and this is just I guess a heat map of sorts for just showing of of just the neighborhoods for battery only on Saturday and Sundays it looks a lot like the aggregate map for battery.;
So can we focus on just the hot spots for each of the neighborhoods?;
So kind of what you did before you got kind of like a cluster of them.;
so for I guess what is it River North The Loop just all the neighborhoods we are analyzing is that specific enough?;
There is two points that would be interesting to see and then there is one trying to think what I think it is just off of Lake Street?;
There is a big hot spot and actually and there is one I think it is Division and Sedgewick?;
Sure.;
I should ask is are these maps is this like for all 4 years?;
Ok cool.;
Awesome that this is perfect.;
Ok so this again like a heat map showing the hot spots for all four years for Saturday and Sunday only of just batteries.;
from this data can we do like a temporal chart?;
But I guess to get to the point is I would target these areas particularly on Saturdays and Sundays.;
you know what I what I want is hours of the day? Like what what time of day particularly on Saturdays and Sunday are these going down.;
Is not that in like Lincoln Park area?;
;
Ok so we got a line chart temporal line chart thing for Saturdays and Sundays of battery across the months just in those hot spots.;
December was kind of popular on Sundays.;
Just 26?;
yeah can I see just like the hours of the day? For those Sunday you know Saturday and Sunday?;
Do your thing.;
;
What are people doing at 2 in the morning?;
I do not get it.;
Ok so there is a bar chart showing hours of the day from 12 midnight to 12 midnight for all four years on just showing batteries on Saturdays and Sundays 2 AM 2 to 3 AM is really popular for battery.;
yeah I guess I would deploy police in those hot spots that we identified particularly on the weekends right around 12 midnight till about 6 AM till about 5 AM actually.;
Ok.;
let us see I know we had a chart of all the crimes across all 4 years?;
I know it is in here somewhere I think maybe this is it?;
Yeah there it is Deceptive practice.;
maybe just bring it up a little bit higher.;
Thank you.;
;
can we look at just deceptive practice and criminal damage?;
Now it would be like a heat map like we did before?;
Yeah how long do you want me do you want me to solve all the crimes?;
Yeah and then as soon as we have that map let us do the same kind of thing just for those two types of crimes.;
that is easy.;
Let is just focus it ignore my last query just focus in on on this one hot spot here and this hot spot right off just right on Randolph for like that kind of range of hot spots?;
Cool is it?;
Yeah.;
This is just a heat map of the neighborhoods in question focusing on the sum number of deceptive practice and criminal damage just in the hot spots. Can we do a temporal graph for these two hot spots?;
and can you split the graph based on criminal damage and then deceptive practice?;
Ok so I guess I guess I am interested in mainly like if I was walking if I was walking to the CTA train if I was walking to the EL would there be any areas that are particularly dangerous to walk through maybe theft or battery or that sort of thing.;
Yes I did.;
Ok so I can see all the crimes here and theft battery and assault over there.;
The battery number seems kind of high up there.;
So I guess the next thing I am wondering is so the of the neighborhoods which which one might have like the least amount of like personal property theft like breaking into an apartment or stealing my stuff or all that sort of stuff?;
Ok.;
So it looks like they are all pretty even.;
Maybe Near West Side not so great.;
You would think from its reputation that River North is less bad but does not really look like it.;
Ok so my next question is are currency exchanges and liquor stores as sketchy as they seem?;
Ok.;
ok so I can see the the type of place crimes by location on the streets seems the definitely the most frequent or inside building.;
and then theft is the most of all and then the other ones and then the currency exchanges definitely being sketchy is still pretty high up there.;
but does not seem to be too physically dangerous so that is good to know.;
So my next question is it seemed like when I used to take the bus a lot that in the summer it was it was worse in the summer so I am wondering around the bus lines or on the bus if there if there is more public intoxication or fighting or verbal harassment in in summer months?;
Ok so it looks like starting with all crimes that absolutely in the summer there is an increase of crime.;
I bet March and November are because of holidays involving alcohol.;
ok the next thing I was wondering about is I think I would like to know the most frequent areas of sexual assault among these neighborhoods. and a lot of people I think are worried about public places but the list also include private residences so I think that is something I would like to know?;
Ok so it is very clear that private indoor buildings are the most dangerous places for sexual assault or most frequent.;
Looks like the Near West Side is a little more it is a little even I guess.;
Ok so over the course the time period that the data set exists has there have there been changes changes in crime I guess my neighborhood have neighborhoods experienced trends in crime over the course of the data set I mean not not all of the crimes but we are mainly focused on robbery and murder probably would be homicide.;
yeah homicide theft slash robbery.;
in all of the neighborhoods for all of the crimes though looks like well for homicide there are so few in these neighborhoods that I can see how the data could be up and down a little bit.;
But overall looks like everything has gone down which is great.;
so my next question is when you take the CTA they say there is no gambling on the CTA. My question is is there gambling on the CTA?;
there were only 2 well I guess that is some gambling on the CTA but the other types of crime on the CTA are sort of what I would expect but there are not an awful lot of them.;
ok near UIC or maybe we had already answered this question but near UIC what is I guess the most literally like what is the most dangerous thing and place at UIC in the UIC area?;
Ok so looks like walking around outside is the most dangerous around UIC.;
sort of south of Roosevelt and near Western and on the downtown side of UIC.;
What types of crimes are happening so I am looking at this number of crimes display and I am wondering on the street and sidewalk what kind of crimes are happening at UIC?;
Ok so starting on the left I can see the types of crime on the street and sidewalk though I am sure there is a law enforcement definition of those things that as a lay person I do not necessarily offer distinction.;
There is a lot of different things that happen on the street.;
and then I can see this figure not super clear on figure 10-2 though I can see it is divided into street and sidewalk and types of crime.;
Is it a map?;
Ok ok.;
So again much more much more yeah. Lots of theft lots of theft.;
Ok. continuing on the theme I guess let us let us choose the most frequent the top one seems like well let us see.;
I am wondering basically are is there days of the week or days of the week you know weekends versus weekdays where these sort of crimes that are around UIC are more or less?;
Ok so it looks like it depends on the crime sort of base range for the least frequent crimes and a slight increase in some of the more the middle ones better in criminal damage it looks like weekends a little more and that people like to steal things on Fridays.;
so yeah starting Friday night a little more crime in UIC.;
what types what types of violations or crimes are being around places of business like small businesses or grocery stores or gas stations that sort of thing.;
Ok I can see by far again theft is the most frequent type of crime.;
but I can clearly see the different places of business and the number of crimes and what type of crime that is very interesting.;
if I wanted to go back we looked at number of different number of crimes by day of the week I am wondering how this varies by neighborhood.;
Ok so all crimes in the different neighborhoods vary by day of the week so it looks like River North really goes nuts starting on Friday and and there is some difference among those neighborhoods.;
alright let me think here.;
I think I want to I think I want to start off simple and try to get more detailed from there.;
So starting off I would just like to see the total amount of crimes that happened divided by the three main areas the UIC River North and Near West Side.;
Just cause I am thinking you know to get it started.;
It is kind of a problem actually.;
What is ?;
What is ? Do we know what that definition is or? ok here we go.;
ok here we go.;
Ok River North Ok.;
Ok River North Ok. is there any way to see kind of a similar division between the four neighborhoods but also track it over I think it is 2010 like by year from the data set 2010 to 2014 or whatever it is.;
See if anything has changed. Or if there is any trend overall.;
Ok.;
Ok. that is an I guess somewhat positive sign.;
Ok so is there any way starting let me think.;
So is there anyway starting off to see what I wan the division of the crime types is in the most recent data set in 2014.;
Starting with that.;
And then.;
Then we will see what that shows and maybe moving on from there it might be good to see trends on that too.;
ok.;
Ok so it looks like I guess kind of what you would expect actually.;
Mostly thefts.;
You can look at it as theft.;
or first of all I was really trying thinking of looking at it as a trend over time for both of them but the effect seems pretty overwhelming right now so I am kind of looking thinking of doing looking more into that.;
Is there any way to kind of show theft by location type?;
Cause then it might be kind of great in terms of figuring out where to put people in terms of police officers.;
Alright.;
I guess that makes sense actually.;
Ok so streets and apartment stores so ok.;
So we know ok.;
First starting off around what time of day do the thefts usually occur in in general?;
Ok.;
Ok. Ok so ok so already we are thinking that it is kind it is kind of somewhat obvious but at the same time like that the most crime is theft on the street particularly in 12 noon to 6 PM time.;
Especially for something like theft which is arguably something that could be affected by having more patrols and more police officers.;
there we go.;
Ok alright.;
So it looks can you make it a little bit bigger?;
Thanks I can see it. It looks like State street.;
Ok so now we know that for in terms of theft and in terms of the general data set overall State street and a few other areas are kind of like hot spots.;
Looks like a little bit around Magnificent Mile or Chicago Avenue.;
Grand ok.;
Now is I guess overall has there been any is there what I am thinking about what I want to think about is if there is been any change in terms of has one area historically not been a problem and then has recently had any kind of drastic difference either good or bad;
In terms of I guess since we are talking about theft we will stay focused on that but that is it would be good to know if certain areas are starting to b more problematic overall.;
ok yeah no that is perfect.;
That is actually ok yeah.;
if we had a dataset that if the dataset had a lot of kind of like more from what we know about what the most popular crimes were if the most popular crimes somehow were things like deceptive practice then maybe we would want to take out some of those because that would not be good for patrols like since basically the vast majority of what the data shows is kind of standard kind of crime that would be affected by police officers.;
ok let us talk so if we are thinking since theft is the biggest crime let us kind of and that is you know what we have kind of that we talked about first.;
Let is kind of look at let us look at something slightly different.;
Let is look at just overall not by year but just overall the number of recorded narcotics violations by geography.;
Ok alright so that is definitely looks slightly different distribution.;
Ok alright so that would be useful to know too.;
ok so that is kind of that is kind of a good way to look at it.;
I trying think if there is any kind of more or clever ways that we can look at the data that maybe are not as standard.;
let us ok so let us say ok bear with me on this one I just want to try something here.;
let us say I know that some of these areas have some have a lot of not I mean I guess they are usually more West than this but some of these areas do have a lot of empty lots which I thought I saw on here but I do not know a vacant lot.;
Is there any way to see what kind of crimes tend to be in vacant lots?;
Ok that is interesting ok.;
ok alright that is that is really interesting.;
How about on the CTA the CTA bus garage or let us do CTA CTA CTA bus and CTA train.;
you found some ok.;
Ok ok.;
Ok.;
;
Ok and ok.;
I was kind of just curious about that.;
I am not sure if I have too much to go down on that path.;
can we do the same thing for CTA bus and CTA train?;
ok.;
Ok ok.;
;
What ok ok.;
I am trying to think if I want to go anywhere with that but I am kind of drawing a blank.;
we can tar  no.;
Let is let us kind of go a go a different way now and let us talk about homicides.;
Ok so that is good information in terms of knowing exactly you know kind of knowing where to put certain kinds of you know like street patrols and things like that probably downtown where there is a lot of people but also if you are looking into the end of high crime and drugs then you would be looking into the South and like Near South Near West.;
ok.;
Is there any way between the three the narcotics homicides and thefts is there any way to do it by time of day and by large area like one of the four areas.;
yes by time of day.;
Is there any way to I know I think we have done some similar things as this already with I think we already did the number of crimes over the years for the three or four things that we were we did it by area that is right.;
is there any way to kind of just do a trend of the type of crime over the last four years?;
Ok that does not look like there is any huge spikes in anything.;
;
Ok.;
Alright so this is good.;
Alright in terms yeah I think that answers a lot of questions all at once.;
theft and battery would mostly be things that if they would happen on the street when your patrols it would still be kind of doing the same patrols probably in similar areas and a lot of the ones that would not be things that a patrol would catch would be things that would have to be called in anyway.;
And then a lot of the there is a lot a lot of these crimes do not have very huge numbers behind them.;
just because it tends to be a another thing that can like cluster somewhere I guess it would probably be useful to see a prostitution map.;
Ok that is kind of interesting.;
Ok and then I guess there is not too much more to say about the prostitution map.;
One thing actually let me look at the crime types here.;
It would be good to know so kind of like the same thing with theft in terms of where does it happen both like where in on the map but also like what kind of location.;
especially since we are dealing with fairly large geographical area and a college area it might be good besides the usual point of the map which is apparently my favorite thing.;
it might be good to pull up a map and see where the most reports are for sexual assault or I guess it is sex offense is what it is listed under.;
And if we are thinking in terms of how I am not privy to how the Chicago Police Department works but most police departments have divisions on homicide and they obviously have beat cops they have homicide divisions they have sexual assault divisions they sometimes have prostitution they always have drug divisions too so that is kind of why I am going through these main categories in my head.;
It is kind of difficult to say because since sexual offense probably can mean a lot of things.;
It is unclear on if you know what kind of offenses we are dealing with.;
is there is there any way to show or either we can do it by map or by area but maybe by map would be easier.;
Is there any way to of the is there any way to narrow it narrow it down by ones that happen in street or alley or sidewalk?;
Ok ok.;
That is interesting.;
ok.;
Alright so we kind of covered that.;
Ca not think of other ways to look at this.;
Did actually I thought in my mind I think I thought I asked this but actually I do not think I did.;
if I did me but did can I see number of crimes all crimes via location type?;
Ok that is what I alright.;
Ok thank you.;
And now I am asking this mostly because of since we have kind of covered just the general areas that is probably the most important thing.;
And kind of divided by crime it just would be interesting to see if certain just general locations.;
I mean obviously street and sidewalk came up but there is other things that would be more surprising so the department stores have a pretty high number but we are also dealing with the downtown area so that is probably not u;
And then so now I guess since we have covered the kind of the general stuff let us just quickly think about UIC in general since they do have their own kind of.;
   police and security kind of thing going on.;
is there anyway to pull up the number of type of crime at UIC just overall I guess?;
Ok so kind of an ongoing trend here.;
theft battery.;
deceptive practice.;
ok.;
Yeah that is interesting.;
Alright I think that I have covered most of what I would want to ask.;
And the only other thing that I probably did not quite cover is if there is I guess the rate of crime in general by day of the week.;
Ok so that is pretty constant.;
Is there a way to divide it up kind of like we did with the number of crimes?;
Well I guess in any way divide it up in terms of you know number of crimes day of the week but divide it up by crime type?;
that is really nice ok.;
Alright so there is not too many I guess real significant things except for probably an increase in battery and criminal damage on the weekends Saturday and Sunday.;
Wait can I have the four areas again?;
The four areas.;
What are the four areas?;
Ok thanks.;
can are you able to like like the entire percentage of in each neighborhood?;
;
Sorry I meant like how many crimes occur that is what I meant.;
oops.;
is this the amount of crime per year?;
For all four years ok.;
Um can you show me the population of each neighborhood?;
Sorry can we look ok at the Near West Side first and are you able to differentiate what types of crimes they were of the?;
So for Near West Side it was mostly theft then battery criminal damage burglary motor vehicle theft.;
of the theft in the Near West Side are you able to kind of show it by month?;
;
it is not that different.;
Let is see.;
can you do the same thing for battery in the Near West Side?;
That is right here.;
So it is decreasing?;
Ok well it seems a little bit low in February but it does not seem drastically different from the summer months to some of the winter months and it is decreasing from 2010 to 2015.;
So it is a little bit higher in the warmer weather but not that much and it is kind of a downward trend over the years.;
can you do the same thing can you do the number of crimes the same thing you did for the Near West Side for the other three neighborhoods UIC River North and the Loop?;
and I will back to it but I was wondering where the location of the thefts in Near West Side?;
Homocide is really almost non existant.;
can you show me the location of theft and battery in the four neighborhoods?;
So street is the highest of all four neighborhoods then side walk department store restaurant other residence parking lot small retail store.;
can you show the time of day of theft and battery in all four neighborhoods when it mostly occurs?;
are you able to show where the crimes occur between 12 noon and 6 and 6 PM and 12 midnight?;
can you show the location type for the crimes that occur between 12 noon and 6 and 6 PM and 12 midnight?;
we are not able to get data based on.;
you guys do not have data on the criminal do you?;
The person who is the crime?;
Ok are you able to split these up between 12 noon and 6 and then one for 6 to 12 midnight?;
is blue the;
Ok and that is the up there?;
Ok.;
So 6 PM to 12 midnight for all locations.;
Street sidewalk restaurant department store and other.;
like individually for street sidewalk department stores and restaurants are you able to that is are you able to show where on a map they occurred? Like what streets what sidewalks what department stores and what restaurants?;
sorry.;
theft and battery all crimes streets department stores restaurants sidewalks.;
;
For for 12 noon to 6 for all crimes can you show for 12 noon to 6 for all crimes for streets department stores restaurants like the one two three for top five locations are you able to do that by month?;
Ok. Noon to 6 yup.;
no that is just Near West Side.;
Is that for all months or just Near West Side?;
do we have for all neighborhoods the month?;
it looks somewhat similar.;
so for this graph you made on my left the top five locations can you just make it for street and sidewalk the outdoor locations by month?;
February is cold.;
it looks similar but it is higher in the summer lower in January February and Decemeber when it is colder and it is a little bit higher in the fall and spring and highest in summer.;
Can you do the same thing for 6 PM to 12 midnight please?;
6 PM 12 noon to 6.;
So it sort of follows the same trend maybe except for October is a little higher 6 PM to 12 midnight but it is highest in the summer months and lowest in the winter months.;
let me think.;
the can you go back so I think you have there is a graph that says number of crimes per month from 12 noon to 6 and 6 to 12 midnight per month.;
can you delineate by neighborhood maybe?;
Or do we already have that graph?;
sorry I did not realize the scales of the graph are different so there is from 6 PM to 12 midnight there is definitely more crimes because it goes up to two thousand per month. And that one is 1500 from 12 noon to 6.;
The highest in River North.;
So for River North can you separate it from 12 noon to 6 and 6 to 12 midnight?;
it is similar.;
On the same graph could you put in the two other time slots? sorry. So 6 AM to 12 noon is the least in the middle of the night is in the middle and then afternoon evening night are the highest.;
am I supposed to make a conclusion?;
Ok do you;
Do do you happen to know if law enforcement is trying to decrease a certain type of crime or they are just looking at overall number of crimes?;
ok well I was looking at theft and battery because it was the highest.;
But do you happen to know if theft is mostly just like wallets being stolen or you or you do not have that data?;
Ok because River North has the highest number of crimes. can you show me the number of crimes in River North by year?;
So in from like or so in 2010 down to about is about in 2014. That is a big decrease.;
you guys do not have?;
so just looking at River North are you able to show me the types of crimes there were in 2010 like the number of crimes in 2010 and the types to 2014?;
This is just for this is for all neighborhoods ok.;
So theft has gone down. Battery has gone down just a little bit. deceptive practice and criminal damage kind of flip flopped and the other ones have gone down a little bit.;
can you make this graph where you show the crime types from 2010 to 2014 for each of the four neighborhoods?;
River North UIC Near West and the Loop.;
so since the Loop number of crimes has not gone down too much can you show me for what let me think. for 2014 can you show me what day of the week most theft occur?;
So Friday and Saturday are the it is kind of like the weekend and the other five days are about the same.;
for Friday and Saturday can you show what times of the day the crimes occur? in 2014 sorry.;
Is there a time limit?;
nevermind.;
So most crimes this is is this for just Friday and Saturdays or every day of the week?;
ok thanks.;
so it seems like most crimes on the first two days of the weekend are from 12 noon to 6 and then second is 6 to 12 midnight which is kind of corresponds with some of the other data for times of the day.;
So it is highest on Friday lowest on Sunday and then kind of the same Monday through Thursday and Saturday.;
for the Loop just for theft can you show show the crimes by month?;
higher in summer months a little bit lower in winter kind of like some of the other monthly data.;
So that is alright.;
I want to see the general spread of the crime type intimidation around UIC area spread by day of the week?;
Ok I was hoping to see a big increase on Fridays but let us see if we can find something related to that.;
for the same spread that is of the day of the week can I have another visualization by by the side of this one which tells me all about public peace violation?;
Ok not too many.;
Ok thank you for the second visualization I think I am done with that.;
I do not see much information out of that.;
;
Can I get a visualization of all the major crime types? For again UIC area?;
Ok.;
Alright.;
2400.;
I see that theft and battery are way theft is obviously the highest and.;
Now I would like to see all crimes involving the crime type theft around UIC for all the different location types?;
Quite a few more vehicle theft as well.;
Ok. I I am seeing that there is a lot of theft and there is most of them are happening on streets.;
now I would like to extend this to see if this is a thing across all the four neighborhoods or if it is very particular to this neighborhood.;
So I would like to see that.;
Ok as I suspected streets are the number one.;
could you have given me two other visualizations.;
Can you make them more legible? Like bigger?;
that is much better.;
Thank you.;
Only amongst theft.;
from this diagram what I can conclude is even though theft is the number one it is particularly more in Near West.;
I will to I mean I I will inquire about that in a bit.;
and one more line of inquiry that I was thinking of could can you bring up this the pic that has been hidden?;
Yes ok.;
Now I would like to see the spread of two crime types that is theft and battery for all the neighborhoods during different days of the week?;
Ok alright. Theft and battery.;
17K 13K.;
Ok this is not this view is not very helpful in I mean not the view but I do not see any any significant variations between the days.;
So maybe I I would like to look at the spread across different months?;
Months of the year only months ok.;
Ok although I have seen the general trend of crimes having a rise around May June July it is still not too steep a curve to be of any particular interest.;
yes the response is fine.;
maybe streets.;
Could you pull up 6-1 and 7-1 into focus?;
The image is 6-1 and 7-1 please.;
Near West.;
Maybe I am not reading the data right but somehow Near West street I mean street theft seems to be much much more in 6-1 and when I it here that is the spread of days the color proportions do not do not match?;
ok.;
Because I see a lot of green in 7-1 whereas I see a lot of orange.;
Sure.;
ok I think I see what the problem is.;
That is only specific to theft whereas this is for theft and battery.;
So I think toward is that I can conclude that theft is the number one crime and it is more in and with that I think I would like to focus more on Near West.;
So I would like to see another visualization that would tell me the second and third or rather all the different crime types that are there in Near West?;
Ok so the graph is almost identical to that of UIC area in terms of what crime is more and what crime how much that is yeah.;
street.;
Can I get a visualization of all the crimes that happen in the Near West area for one particular type location type that is street?;
Theft criminal damage motor vehicle theft battery.;
Ok I expected theft and motor vehicle theft to be somewhat closely closely related but seeing criminal damage up there was a bit surprising.;
Yes this yeah this is what I expected.;
ok so.;
Day by year day by year.;
can I get a spread of this data across the year?;
Ok.;
Ok.;
2012.;
ok.;
Could you single out theft alone and give that data for a year when I say a year can I a by day spread over the year?;
Ok ok.;
There are yes this response it helps.;
there there are a few peaks and I am wondering if these peaks have a particular pattern to them or do they happen over some events?;
2014 2014.;
Thank you.;
This one is it clarifies things much more.;
Ok June 22 nd.;
Ok but if I take into account the number of crimes that is the y-axis even though June 22 nd is a peak it it would be wrong for me to conclude that it is some kind of a a pattern.;
Ok ok.;
For the same graph can I see theft and criminal damage as two lines overlapping like multiline graph?;
Ok thank you.;
Ok thank you.;
Yes this is what I was looking for.;
;
With a few exceptions I think the ups and downs of both the curves roughly match up when there is a dip in one there is a dip in the other when there is a rise in one there is a rise in the other with a few offsets and stuff.;
Ok;
Criminal damage.;
Could you give me the same visualization for UIC area?;
Ok and that is sort of the peak.;
Again one roughly follows the other.;
ok.;
I was hoping to see an overall rise and dip pattern in the UIC area that was that is similar to what I see in the Near West but that is I which tells me that day of the year was not a factor?;
but yeah criminal damage and theft I see a correlation of sorts.;
Do you have time of the day available for this data set?;
Ok may I see just theft and criminal damage for Near West during different times of the day?;
Time of the day.;
I see a small similarity in the way these I mean these two different crime types progress over or spread across different hours of the day but since there is aggregation it is not it it is not that evident or it is not that conclusive to say that to clarify my my suspicion about the data.;
for the graph on 18-2 is it possible to further divide the data into or order them somehow depending on the time of day that they occurred on these days?;
Ok.;
Just a minor correction to the request that I made.;
I just want to see two types that is theft and criminal damage I do not want to see the third crime type.;
they have theft and criminal damage?;
;
Ok.;
yes I mean.;
Ok well what I what I actually wanted to see was all the all the theft crimes in a single line that how do I say this ok on the x-axis of each day also fine grained into hour of the day.;
I do not know if that is too much data into a graph but is that does that make sense?;
Is it clear?;
Ok.;
Ok well in these I would say the bottom two charts are less helpful in that case and the upper two are better.;
because these provide me with line graphs of specific events and specific hours even though at this I mean in this particular chart since the lines talk about specific trends for each hour of the day it is harder to see even if there is any correlation because yeah it it is just too spread out.;
Then day two and so on on the x-axis and number of crimes on the y-axis is that possible?;
That would give a linear ordering of crimes in time and that is what I basically want to see.;
Yes this is what I was looking for.;
Can you stretch these two visualizations on the x-axis like just pull;
Yeah yeah.;
Yes this is this is fine.;
ok.;
Two three ok.;
;
I just have a remark with this visualization I mean although I have a strong feeling that they are both correlated in the sense that somehow either the data is being duplicated in terms of two different crime types or something else is going on there.;
And this view helps.;
But I will have to look at a larger range in order to make any conclusions on that.;
So yup.;
yes it was great. Thanks.;
Ok first off I;
Can you show me the number of crimes for the four regions separately?;
Because I want to see which region has the highest rate of crime.;
So can you show me the distribution of different crime types? I want to know exactly the number of different crime types.;
Ok so it shows that the theft battery deceptive practice and criminal damage have the highest rate of crime.;
So it means that maybe we should focus on these crimes mostly.;
Ok so can you show me the number of crimes for each hour in a day? I want to know the frequency of the crimes during the day.;
So between 12 up to 19 we have the highest rate of crime.;
I do not need this chart and can you move it?;
But I want to keep this one cause it is better it is not nessessary to see.;
Ok. So can you plot the same chart for the day of the weeks I mean the number of the crimes for each day?;
So the number of the crimes at Fridays and Saturdays are generaly higher than other days but during the week its some extent have we need more officers on the weekends.;
So I do not need this one but I want to keep this one.;
ok so can you do it for different months of the year the same plots I mean the number of the crimes for different months in a year?;
so it shows that the lowest rate of crime is in Feburary and Janurary and the highest rates are in June July August.;
Ok so can you plot me the same plot I mean the number of the crimes during the day for different regions?;
So so it shows that between 12 noon and 6 PM Loop has the highest rate of crime but during other hours it has the lowest rate of crime.;
After that we can send them to other regions and ok River North ok.;
and we can do the same for other regions?;
Ok can you can you normalize this plot by the size of each region and the area size can you normalize it?;
Yes. it is good if you can show me the map I can estimate the size myself.;
So UIC and Near West seems to have the same area size. The smallest one is the Loop. That so it shows that the the Loop UIC and the Near West have the the highest area size also the highest rate for the crimes but the densety of the crimes is very high in the.;
. It.;
Can you show me the total number of total crimes in each year?;
And this one is not useful in my purpose.;
So it shows that in general number of crimes has decreased over the recent years this one.;
And can you do the same for the four frequent crimes I mean theft battery deceptive practice criminal damage?;
So it shows that in general the number of the thefts battery and criminal damage have decreased but the number of deceptive practice has gotten little bit increased;
So it means that deceptive practice has increased and we should be careful about this type of crime.;
Can you do the same for the next four type of crimes. And for the frequency?;
So most of this crimes have not changed or even some places decreased.;
So it means that so the only the only crime that has increased over the recent years is deceptive practice.;
Ok that is fine.;
Ok can you show me the number of crimes based on the location and type of location?;
So most of the crimes have occurred on the streets.;
So can I see the visualization for crime in the Chicago neighborhoods like the overall crime?;
crime I mean.;
yes so can you show me any graph or visualization?;
ok can you show me burglary I mean ok.;
Here crime frequency.;
Can you widen it? I mean. horizontally I mean the x-axis?;
So this is specifically for four neighborhoods and crime is from 2010 till 14.;
And can you show me the distribution of crimes with respect to the crime types?;
So in this case River North has the maximum crime reported.;
After that it is Near West and UIC and Loop seems to be the safest out of these four.;
So can you show me the crime distribution in River North?;
it is processing.;
it seems that the crime distribution is for all the neighborhoods but I would like to see the crime distribution specifically for River North.;
The same pattern we can see in River North but.;
can you show only the bar graph or do you have some any other way of visualizing the same?;
Thank you.;
Ok.;
So here in this graph I mean sorry station in River North theft seems to cover the larger area so it corresponds to the same thing so.;
Ok in UIC its also theft in Loop ok.;
And the next ok.;
And if we see here the ok.;
So can we remove this graph and just can you refocus on the other one yes?;
Ok yeah.;
This seems to be a better one and here.;
If we see in Loop we have theft and then the second highest is deceptive practice.;
So if we need to focus like which crime types to target then in general it seems theft and battery. These two should be considered the priority.;
And what do you think?;
That is.;
Yes.;
Ok and.;
Ok can you show me now for each year the crime distribution in the four neighborhoods?;
Meanwhile one more question like which crime types to target are we looking neighborhood wise on in general?;
Ok.;
Ok so in 05-2 image we can see that we see that the crime rate with respect to each progressing here.;
Ok and what exactly is 05-1 graph about?;
Is another view is.;
I think the first I mean 05-2 is a better it it is a better way to I mean visualize rather than these four separately.;
yes.;
Ok and we can also make out from this graph that the highest crime as we saw in the first graph ok.;
Now can we is it the 01 the yes?;
So here we see that over the entire time frame it is the same here River North both have.;
Can you show the I mean for 2014 month wise crime reported in each neighborhood?;
Ok.;
So in if we see what 06-2.PNG so in Loop the highest crime is reported in August?;
So the pattern we can make out from these two graphs is basically that what I said earlier is the crime reported during summer and fall time it is higher to the winter time.;
Ok and so that is according to the month and what about the crime rate reported according to day of the week? Can you show me visualization for that?;
Ok that is by days of week.;
It is during the crime reported is more during the weekdays rather than the weekends.;
So and what about the time of the day like crime reported with respect to the time of the day?;
Ok so here it is.;
Ok so first we will focus on River North.;
So ok so this is for year I mean days of the week and time.;
So for specifically this is for 2014 can you show me these three corresponding graphs that is with respect to month days of the week and year for years 2010 11 12 13 and 14?;
Let is start the time of the day and day of the week ok.;
Ok and here it is June there is ok and.;
Can we align the 2013 graph so it is easier? I mean can we align graphs the month ok.;
Yeah that is better.;
Ok so here it is in July and August in 2010.;
Between March so where did the graph go?;
I am sorry can you minimize it? And no can you place it the where place where it was?;
thank you.;
I am just trying to figure ok so that is from March till October and here ok.;
So I already told my answer it should be River North and also UIC because that is what we can make from the graph that the crime rate is still high in River North and UIC to the other two neighborhoods.;
Ok so now can you close all these graphs and show me the crime reported with respect to the location type specifically in River North and UIC? Over the period 2010 till 2014?;
If you want you can close these graphs as I will not be needing it anymore.;
Can you show me year wise separate graph like for 2010 and 2011 12 13 14?;
Ok ok meanwhile from these remaining graphs we can observe that street is the favorite location for the criminal people and then yes.;
So which location has the highest crime rate recorded?;
So I can see there River North has the highest crime rate.;
So what type of crimes;
Editing title? What is editing title?;
So can I see the intersection between the River North and the street sidewalk and residence views?;
Like yeah.;
So is the status not changing?;
here how can we identify the neighborhoods here? Which is a street and which is a sidewalk?;
Yeah so I want to know the intersection between the River North area I want to know what is the what are the neighborhoods that a have the highest crime rate in River North?;
Is it is it street are the are the streets is it the sidewalk area? So I need to know that.;
Which specific to River North.;
So can can you explain a bit about what is this criminal damage and this this deceptive practice? So what kind of deceptive practice?;
So there is a criminal damage and so what kind of deceptive practice is it? I mean deceptive practice in the sense somebody is mocking somebody and?;
So like which which part of the days is the crime higher?;
With this graph with the last graph I want to know which part of the day is the crime very high?;
Or give me the graph of the crime crime rate in this River North with respect to the which part of the day.;
So can you give the analysis through or what are the days has the crime rate? Day by day analysis can I get a day by day analysis? Day and time maybe.;
Yeah so this is expected. On weekends the crime crime rate is high. And on but on Sundays its relatively lesser on Fridays and Saturdays is it it is very high.;
So on Saturday at which location can you can you say can you give me a graph with respect to Saturday and the location type alone on River North.;
So in this graph I can see that on Saturday 6 PM to 12 midnight and 12 noon to 6 PM is higher and this pattern is repeated everywhere. Except on Sunday 12 midnight to 6 PM is very high.;
So maybe people start doing their criminal activities from 6 PM to 12 midnight and continue to the Sunday morning maybe.;
So how do you differentiate from street and sidewalk here? Street has a sidewalk right? So;
Well especially on the sidewalk.;
So street and sidewalk dominate everywhere.;
so I want day by month and day by year analysis of this graph. Of the River North crimes.;
So on February it is it is very less so do you but because maybe I think the reason is because on February there is 28 days there are only 28 days. So do you normalize that here?;
not normalized ok. Because of that this is more or less similar all the months more or less have a similar crime rate.;
So I want a year by analysis of of this.;
So here I could distribution is more or less uniform here.;
So can you give me that give me a graph of the highest type of crime that has occurred each year?;
Like 2010 theft is the highest crime like that I want a graph like that.;
What does this line represent? Is it theft of?;
Because more or less the colors are same for blue.;
So here also it represents a total pattern so theft is higher theft was higher in the River North so.;
So if I want to do the task of working out what areas to deploy officers then do I get to see a crimes for that city?;
Yeah that is fine.;
Yeah so I can see what is going on up here.;
What would this means got a lot of activity here.;
Did we just want to look at areas to deploy within the middle of the city which means we are cutting out all the south side?;
Ok.;
Yeah so you see there is a lot of activity around here.;
Can we zoom in on Loop?;
Ok.;
Have you got any type of data on what kind of activity there is in Loop?;
Ok that is great thank you.;
Ok. So these might look a little bit easier to read if they were rotated?;
it seems like there is just lots of theft and battery.;
Ok. Alright We know that theft is the biggest problem around here.;
Can we see the crime types for the other three regions as well?;
It is quite interesting that what happens in Loop is a different type of crime than what happens overall.;
Ok. So we know that theft is the main issue but depends what part of the city it is.;
let us have a look at yeah let us look at the time of day. Is there any kind of graph showing theft throughout the day?;
Actually is there a way that we can actually see throughout one day the top ten crimes how often they happen?;
Ok thank you.;
;
So that is just theft.;
Ok so I want to so the title is right the crimes in region by time of day but there is;
Nothing on there which shows the time of day or ok.;
Give me the same of this with battery deceptive practices and criminal damage and assault please.;
;
That is very different.;
That makes sense.;
So it seems like most activity seems to go up between 12 noon and 6 except for battery.;
So maybe that is not a type of crime you can try to prevent in this way.;
Ok let us have a look at theft or wait let us let us keep with the theft. Can we see the breakdown for theft throughout the week?;
Yeah that is great. Could this is quite interesting.;
Can we see the breakdown of the whole week for all crimes?;
Wow that is a lot of stuff there. Alright Ok thank you.;
I like this one. This one is nice.;
;
Thank you.;
So definitely these ones down are really quite insignificant and if it were just theft huge here.;
I can see why these two would be high on Friday Saturday people out and about.;
that is quite interesting what over here we yeah I can pretty much see everything from over here see so do not Yeah do not need this one here.;
Ok let us have a look at can you have this graph for months of year?;
great.;
ok I guess that makes sense people go away during winter.;
But it seems that it is general all year round thing except for the theft and a little bit of battery surprisingly.;
So this would show a lot of the crime patterns.;
How about the breakdown of crime for each year?;
Well it is good to see that crime is actually fallen but for this one here that would be that kind of so crime all seems to have gone down.;
Ok let us have a look;
Well how are we going to have a look at hot spots?;
Are there any other kind of heat maps we can see other than this one up here? Are there any other kind of maps we can see? Or is this the only one we have?;
yeah let us take the most significant ones to look up.;
Can we have the heat map of thefts?;
Ok can we see the same with deceptive practices?;
I think it is River North that is got the highest crime well especially;
Can we see actually can we see all crimes categorized well the number of crimes in each area?;
So it looks like River North is really high for for theft.;
Probably want to tackle bring those numbers down more.;
Go after that.;
The time of day of that we did have a nice graph around here somewhere for that.;
This one down here.;
Good that is it.;
So that was Friday Saturday. Lot happens there good thank you.;
Ok well which which of these which of the I do not know.;
I would like to know which of the four areas has the highest incidence of homicide battery assault sex offense kidnapping just I guess to know where to feel the most worried?;
When walking down the street basically.;
And I would probably limit that to to the street when you get inside the building there is usually another security situation there.;
Just interested yeah because yeah it would be nice best to see like yeah like kind of sort of a heat map of of violent crime. just to see that in general.;
Cause you always hear that right?;
So you think well there is a lot of money down in the Loop so there is a lot less crime.;
Crimes by region.;
So this is going to be the relative proportion.;
Ok so I guess I am curious what the scale is here. Is this just by area? Or by number of people who live there? Number of people who work there?;
working on a certain size by these are just raw numbers.;
Yeah but down here crimes by region.;
Battery the worst is in River North but slightly. Assault that is funny. Near West look by raw counts. I do not know I feel like yeah I think you can improve that visualization.;
I need to know do you have any numbers about population?;
population we do not know about population. Do we know about area?;
See it is not going to tell it will actually tell me the opposite.;
Cause I am I am assuming in River North and especially in the Loop there is just gobs of people with wallets.;
So I am not too surprised you are stealing more of them cause that is where I would go if I wanted to steal.;
If I wanted to knock somebody over the head and that is also sort of consistent.;
So what is the police presence in and how do we measure that?;
Do not have what do we have?;
Ok can we limit this to just by crimes that happen on the street?;
Or do we not have that data or?;
Man I do not know it is just I am having a hard time equation it is like a pie chart only less effective.;
Really what I want to know is where the concentration of people is.;
We need data looks like foot traffic.;
I mean if I am worried about the street which is what I am worried about.;
River North.;
And we do not have any data about where the police currently are?;
sorry do not have that data.;
Yeah I guess I can sort of see how maybe you would not.;
Cause then criminals could look at that and know where to go.;
so we can not really measure how effective well really what you would want is the kind of like the deployment of the police on certain areas and its effect on crimes sort of a gross you know Giuliani is that Giuliani?;
Yeah well let us talk about time of day.;
can we get a range of time of day?;
Like I do not know some sort like I mean I would focus battery and assault.;
The other ones are too rare to but I will tell you that murder line looks a little thicker for UIC.;
but yeah I why do not we look I do not know I guess I would focus on Near West and UIC and give me some sort of a breakup by time.;
Make a decision I am focusing just on the two I think need resources I think that makes sense.;
I do not know problem. Yeah I do not see day of week time of day yeah I guess all of that is interesting.;
Wait this is all crime types and location types this is all crime types and location types.;
I do not want all crime types I just I just wanted battery and assault.;
And I would actually throw I would I would put River North back up on the list.;
How many violent crime that is another thing it is like you in order these are crimes that are crimes that are reported I assume.;
Do we have any data on crimes that are solved?;
That might also indirectly you know it would also indirectly tell you give you a sense of where to not rob.;
Yeah so day of week?;
Ok so can you do something with day of week?;
Just same crimes battery and assault same crimes.;
Instance be interesting to see if we could just.;
I really want to know about population density.;
But yeah for now.;
it is fun I can see I mean people would people would like doing this.;
Date week boy.;
Well atleast two neighborhoods and probably that third neighborhood third non Loop neighborhood at night on the weekends.;
Well ok well wait a minute so we do not know that.;
so can I look can I look at by time of day and on the weekend?;
Well it is good that we are all on one street we can begin with because we are going to make the cops tour all night on the weekends.;
Then we saw spikes on the weekend did we?;
Can we ask questions like that?;
Ok wait a minute what did I just look at?;
Cause I am feeling pretty good about let us get these two neighborhoods maybe that third neighborhood too on the weekend and and at night.;
I think the data that out.;
But now I am thinking they want me to point to some visualization that makes that really obvious.;
And I think we built sort I think we I think we have charts we can pick to do that.;
what we do not have is.;
Ok we sort of identified a change in crime pattern by time of day. We did not get it month of the year.;
How could ok where is did it get smaller?;
this guys so what can we do with this guy?;
to get I want another dimension here that is that is like month of the year.;
So it is almost like I I want 12 of 12 lines or 12 I do not know how you would visualize that.;
should do yes multiple visualizations that is what I want I want multiple visualizations of this result.;
I am pointing to it probably can not see it of this the the crimes in region by day of week just battery and assault.;
Actually yeah all of this with the bars or this thing.;
This looks like we really want just kind of the curve to where to put where to put the police.;
I am sorry you need me to clarify.;
So so crimes in regions by day of week just battery and assault.;
But I want to see different I want to see different lines for each month of the year.;
So then maybe if if it gets cold crime goes down atleast the cops can go where it is warm maybe take their vacations in the winter.;
I do not understand this chart these both say just ok this ok so this the month is up there ok.;
And this is giving me a very gentle pump ok.;
I do not know I guess I do not understand this the where it is just weekend here on the chart because I got Sunday through Saturday. So that is not just the weekend. But all the information is there it just seems like it is for the whole week.;
so what is that see this is more what I was thinking yeah yeah yeah ok.;
This is giving me the Sunday through Saturday we have the spikes up here and then we can see we can see the worst months yeah you sort of lose you kind of lose the the dates.;
The idea here I mean I think what we are missing here is crime hot spots.;
I mean do you have like geographic hot spot do you have any data that breaks down the neighborhood by smaller divisions I do not know blocks or?;
You do? Great.;
what was the worst neighborhood?;
well I want to look into a neighborhood I walk through UIC.;
So let us look at can we look at the UIC neighborhood and number of battery and assault cases by block?;
And there was the other thing I did not get at is the trend.;
That is really what I want to look at right?;
So you want to look at so you you pick your neighborhood and you pick your trend and and then you put I am assuming resources allocated to the area changed over time and see if there is a correlation.;
Can you get me every six months?;
crap going to have like variations within the segment.;
Well let us just go by year so can you get me the annual number of assault and battery cases in I do not know. I guess just the UIC neighborhood for now.;
But maybe not for this type of crime.;
That that is another thing.;
Well ok I guess you can say if conditions have been sort of getting better so maybe it is less.;
So things are getting better well that is nice.;
I am just curious do we show the trend for all crime?;
Yes we do or yes you can do that for me?;
Can you show me the.;
Are you saying that yes we do see the same trend or yes you can draw me a picture of.;
I am assuming the latter.;
can we see this this sort of hot spot map by time?;
