so i have got to figure out where to deploy officers 
alright so show me [Est<1><01-1*,01-2*,01-3>: the the months Est<1><01-1*,01-2*,01-3>] where [Est<1><01-1*,01-2*,01-3>: the most number Est<1><01-1*,01-2*,01-3>] of [Est<1><01-1*,01-2*,01-3>: crimes Est<1><01-1*,01-2*,01-3>] occur around [Est<1><01-1*,01-2*,01-3>: school areas. Est<1><01-1*,01-2*,01-3>]
What question would you like to answer?
Yes here is ok I will think out loud.
I am thinking that the schools are in in session from a certain number of months in during the year and then the schools are out of session for some certain number of months during the year.
And I am wondering if the crime scene changes around those schools in session month and the school out of session month and which crimes are more prevalent when school is in session and when school is out of session.
is it ok if i sit on this table 
or do you want me to stand 
ok no that is fine 
i will just walk around and look at it this is good 
ok so what is happening at the beginning of this chart where all all the bars are high 
[Text<2*><01-2*>: It Text<2*><01-2*>] says crime type and month of year looks like.
why do not i try over here 
Oh yeah [Text<3><01-3>: that Text<3><01-3>] is much more helpful.
Ok so this is interesting.
So there is no age related data [Text<4><01-3>: here Text<4><01-3>] so.
It is ok that is ok.
so the biggest crimes the most number of crimes are theft.
And they seem to go up during July and August.
And a little bit a little bit of a blip in January.
In the beginning of January it is probably Christmas.
So can we narrow in on [Est<5><02-1,02-2>: June Est<5><02-1,02-2>] to [Est<5><02-1,02-2>: September theft data Est<5><02-1,02-2>] and where it is happening?
So most of it is happening at streets restaurants.
What is the difference between a street and a sidewalk for theft?
so street could include people robbing from cars breaking into cars.
So is there [Est<6><03>: a time of day Est<6><03>] when the or [Est<6><03>: time of day Est<6><03>] when [Est<6><03>: the street Est<6><03>] [Est<6><03>: theft Est<6><03>] from [Est<6><03>: June Est<6><03>] to [Est<6><03>: September Est<6><03>] is is happening more frequently?
What is the time of day look like for that street data?
That is really interesting.
So is there a way to show how many officers were on these particular streets here where it looks like most of these
well first of all tell me if I am reading these correctly.
So the numbers of crimes by hours are kind of the six hour segments are overlaid with these red dots and the darker the red the more is where the higher concentration is of crime.
So if the theory is that we need one of the hypotheses is that we need more officers on the street we would need to figure out how many officers were or are not typically on the streets between 12 noon and 12 midnight.
and let us just say we pick this area here just north and West of Grant Park around Randolph.
Ok no that that is fine.
to go down that thesis path we would need to know what we had as a baseline because there may be no officers in which case yeah it makes sense to put them on streets between 12 noon and 12 midnight.
my guess is there probably are some officers walking patrolling those areas 
so it may not be an officer issue 
it may not be a manpower issue 
ok so let us see 
let us see where else we can go 
So by year this is interesting so we are only looking at one year here.
Are there [Est<8><04>: other years Est<8><04>] that we can look at [Est<8><04>: [Text<7><03>: this exact same picture? Text<7><03>] Est<8><04>]
This is all four years 2010 to 2014 ok.
yeah let us break it out 
let us break out that picture that 03 png and see what that looks like by year 
looks like they are doing a good job 
still 6 to 12 midnight is a tough time 
Ok let us can we do [Est<10><05>: [Text<9><04>: that same picture Text<9><04>] Est<10><05>] of [Est<10><05>: data Est<10><05>] that we just did for [Est<10><05>: crimes Est<10><05>] could we do it I mean for [Est<10><05>: theft Est<10><05>] can we do it for [Est<10><05>: battery? Est<10><05>]
This there is a lot going on in [Text<11><05>: this picture Text<11><05>] here.
Ok so battery really dropped from 12 midnight to 6 AM between 2010 and 2011.
What can we infer about what was happening to make that drop happen?
Do we have data that tells us anything about that?
can so when i am looking at this i what am i looking for here 
i am seeing a good trend things are going down 
instances are going down 
Overall there is a few of them that are trending upward between 2013 and 2014.
So maybe we pick [Est<12><07>: an area Est<12><07>] well first can we pick one of [Est<12><07>: an actual location Est<12><07>] and look at the I mean [Est<12><07>: the time Est<12><07>] around [Est<12><07>: that particular location? Est<12><07>]
Ok great so let us pick this big red dot over here.
let us see it looks like it is madison and state and madison right there 
There is two big red dots there.
State and Madison and then State I guess it is Lake.
it is State and Washington.
State and Washington State and Madison.
Ok so what are these colors telling me?
There is a lot of.
Yes you have got the location absolutely.
i am i am just trying to figure out what that grid pattern means 
But there is two hot spots right there.
Those two dark red spots where it looks like there is a real concentration.
I guess my question is what is what is at those two bright red spots?
Yes number of crimes.
I guess I am looking for what buildings are there?
Or if it is an EL stop or something?
let us do this then with the data that we got there 
[Est<13><08-1-2>: Those two big red spots Est<13><08-1-2>] let us take [Est<13><08-1-2>: a year Est<13><08-1-2>] by [Est<13><08-1-2>: year Est<13><08-1-2>] [Est<13><08-1-2>: picture Est<13><08-1-2>] of [Est<13><08-1-2>: the crime data Est<13><08-1-2>] that is happening in [Est<13><08-1-2>: those two spots. Est<13><08-1-2>]
this is a little bit like talking to siri only with better results 
no do not worry about it 
generally all she ever can give you is like websites and stuff 
Ok so can we now look at [Est<14><09-1>: that purple line Est<14><09-1>] for [Est<14><09-1>: theft Est<14><09-1>] in [Est<14><09-1>: that hot spot Est<14><09-1>] on [Est<14><09-1>: a month Est<14><09-1>] to [Est<14><09-1>: month basis? Est<14><09-1>]
So could we do like [Est<15><09-2>: an overlay Est<15><09-2>] of [Est<15><09-2>: 2010 Est<15><09-2>] [Est<15><09-2>: January Est<15><09-2>] to [Est<15><09-2>: December Est<15><09-2>] with [Est<15><09-2>: the next few years Est<15><09-2>] so we see if like there is [Est<15><09-2>: a change Est<15><09-2>] from [Est<15><09-2>: year Est<15><09-2>] to [Est<15><09-2>: year Est<15><09-2>] across [Est<15><09-2>: the months Est<15><09-2>] in [Est<15><09-2>: theft? Est<15><09-2>]
you are working on more 
is this real data 
it is pretty amazing 
based on this you realize what a kind of a bum rep chicago is been getting on the crime scene 
the numbers do not seem i mean it is not great but it does not look as bad as they make it seem 
and it is also been going down 
So if we had to just make one inference right now from this data based on those two spots it looks like some time around October to running up to the new year the crimes in those in that really the big hot spot it is making that hot spot that red because of theft and most of that theft is happening from October to late December.
Is that a fair inference?
So I guess if I had data now on how many officers were on the streets during that period from October to December I would probably double check to see where those officers were and whether they were walking or in cars and why the streets felt like they could be why people on the streets felt like they could be robbed or looked like they could be robbed.
i guess that is all i can infer 
But I would look at that data cause those are the two biggest hot spots there.
I suppose [Est<17><10-1*,10-2,10-3-2,10-4>: the next thing Est<17><10-1*,10-2,10-3-2,10-4>] we could do is look at [Est<17><10-1*,10-2,10-3-2,10-4>: the other hot spot Est<17><10-1*,10-2,10-3-2,10-4>] that you had for [Est<17><10-1*,10-2,10-3-2,10-4>: crimes Est<17><10-1*,10-2,10-3-2,10-4>] which is up in [Est<17><10-1*,10-2,10-3-2,10-4>: the North side Est<17><10-1*,10-2,10-3-2,10-4>] if that is the zero [Est<17><10-1*,10-2,10-3-2,10-4>: [Text<16><01-1>: the the the 12-1.PNG. Text<16><01-1>] Est<17><10-1*,10-2,10-3-2,10-4>]
That is the number of crimes that are all the crimes.
But now let us see.
Do we have more time to do one more?
Alright so let us see what we can find out about Chicago Avenue it is just off of Michigan so like right right it is like Chicago Michigan right there.
i think so simplistic answer is go where the money is 
show me the hot spot let us see what crimes are being or happening there 
we have done some of this data with the 3-11 data for tagging of graffiti where you say you could see where the busiest number 
that is the 3-11 database 
yeah that is pretty interesting to look at 
and it you know it is sense you know where where there is an el stop where the taggers hop down off 
get back on and get away 
that is pretty much where you see the big red dots 
It is interesting they break out robbery versus I guess robbery means they had to break in or something.
it is not until you get home and you realize my wallet is missing 
and how is that defined 
breaking down a door 
why would you go in there unless you are just going to sit around and wait for them to home 
still wondering why they are in there 
Ok so it is still theft.
slightly different there june and july are higher than october and december 
so it is seasonal 
when people are downtown shopping on the magnificent mile they are more likely to get robbed 
Theft and deceptive practice.
So we you in your thing it describes where the crime occurred?
Like where it occurs on a parking lot or the lake front or the convenience store.
Is there a way to show that data for one of these months?
Alright let us pick a month.
what do we need for month 
let us pick wow 
something happened in 2012 that started driving the crime down 
certainly on that is hot spot 2 
crime type that is hot spot 2 ok 
no no do not worry i am just talking up here 
alright here is the question in 
i am going to go back to hot spot 1 and look at the month of november and then let us just pick a year 
[Est<18><11-1,11-2*,11-3*>: hot spot Est<18><11-1,11-2*,11-3*>] November yep and then let us find out where what [Est<18><11-1,11-2*,11-3*>: the location type Est<18><11-1,11-2*,11-3*>] was of [Est<18><11-1,11-2*,11-3*>: the thefts. Est<18><11-1,11-2*,11-3*>]
And you can do [Est<21><11-1,11-2*,11-3*>: [Text<19><11-1,11-2*,11-3>: it Text<19><11-1,11-2*,11-3>] Est<21><11-1,11-2*,11-3*>] by [Est<21><11-1,11-2*,11-3*>: year Est<21><11-1,11-2*,11-3*>] or you can lump [Est<21><11-1,11-2*,11-3*>: [Text<20><11-1,11-2*,11-3>: them Text<20><11-1,11-2*,11-3>] Est<21><11-1,11-2*,11-3*>] all together either one works for me.
what software are you guys using to draw these maps 
are there any things about the software that you wish were changed 
maps like the actual cities and streets that kind of stuff 
still it does the job mostly 
i suppose if you had to hone in on it you would have to overlay google earth or something 
yeah or you would have to construct the city specific map structure 
but these i mean this data has all been normalized around this library of names 
so if somebody in calling something other than what you have called it you do not have any kind of semantic mapping yet 
so are you working on that or are 
when it goes into a crime report 
is there anything else that i you need me to be doing that i am not doing 
so this almost looks like shop lifting 
predominantly happening at a department store 
Well that would explain why in crime spot number one which is mostly right there near the the downtown shopping areas and also crime spot number 2.
that is up there near like the nike store places like that right 
all those rich old ladies pocketing scarves 
anyways there is a camera 
ok ok well that is pretty interesting so this relative to a city now b one of those really interesting questions 
does the city have to police the department store does the department store have to bring in more of its own private officers to watch the stores 
That so this is not so much person on person crime as it is person from store crime.
Is that what the inference that you would draw from that?
This is not like like you reaching into my wallet I mean my purse and taking my wallet this is you know you go in to a department store picking up a pair of sunglasses and walking out.
That is theft right?
so that is very telling 
so if i were really cynical i would want to dig deep into which department stores are reporting the most number of crimes 
and what their insurance rates look like 
but that would be that would but this is a private public interface that is pretty cool i would think 
so that is crime 
cause then the so if we wrap everything that we have seen up here which is this is phenomenal by the way data analysis expert very good we see we can highlight where the biggest number of crimes are 
we can see that the predominant number of crimes relative on a scale is theft 
most of that theft is happening in those two areas and most of it is happening at department stores on the northern shore on the northern end of michigan avenue it happens in the summer 
and the downtown area when everybody is looking down there shopping at christmas and for the holidays its happening down at the state street stores 
state street tends to get more of a bad rep which is really interesting 
so that is that is an important distinction 
a very important distinction for this city and the way it counters counterbalances some of the racial stereotypes that we have 
and then if you look at the city from a distance most people would never even think that this was where most number of crime is in the city they are focused on murder 
and let me see what that is called up here 
That is what they are focussed on.
And that barely that barely even was a blip on our picture.
let us bring back up our all our crimes the crime type and then yeah that one that one yep that one 06-3.png that is a good one 
homicide a brown line it is hard to even see.
i think it is down here around at where arson is 
But maybe we should take homicide to battery.
Take out [Est<24><12-1*,12-2>: theft Est<24><12-1*,12-2>] and just do [Est<24><12-1*,12-2>: homicide Est<24><12-1*,12-2>] to [Est<24><12-1*,12-2>: battery Est<24><12-1*,12-2>] put them on put them in [Est<24><12-1*,12-2>: the same picture Est<24><12-1*,12-2>] and see who pops up.
So then we will have a zero to 6k scale and we will see a little more of a
can you do like event mapping too with tableau like if you were to take a major news events and overlay them like if like if we really were having to do a report for the city like i would say probably that you know this battery picture here where you start to see some of the data go back up 
ok what was happening in the news then 
was somebody was being elected somebody was being pushed out of office was it really bad weather 
so media related some of that stuff 
i know somebody i need to get in here to be one of you subjects 
how many are you guys looking for 
how big is your data set going to be for tests 
you are getting close 
Haha look at that.
Look at the correlation between homicide and battery.
that still makes i mean you do not want to get hit that is awful 
but wow what that is a huge jump 
and the number of homicides in the whole region 
well so here is where the event data thing in cause this was an election year right 
so if you were really going to zero in on that homicide picture you would want to look at where it was happening on either side of this from 2011 to 2013 
You know like what areas and and what location type.
Yeah yes I will form that as a question.
let us look at [Est<25><13>: the years Est<25><13>] [Est<25><13>: 2011 Est<25><13>] to [Est<25><13>: 2013 Est<25><13>] for [Est<25><13>: homicide Est<25><13>] and look at [Est<25><13>: the location type Est<25><13>] where [Est<25><13>: the crimes Est<25><13>] occurred.
Ok so street apartment.
Those are where the most of these are happening the homicide in the region for those months.
So so you can take or can you take [Est<27><14>: these two pieces Est<27><14>] of [Est<27><14>: data Est<27><14>] [Est<27><14>: the street Est<27><14>] and [Est<27><14>: apartment Est<27><14>] for [Est<27><14>: 2011 Est<27><14>] to [Est<27><14>: 2013 Est<27><14>] and show them on [Est<27><14>: [Gesture<26><01-1>: the map? Gesture<26><01-1>] Est<27><14>]
So what kind of [Est<28><15-1,15-2*,15-3*,15-4*>: data Est<28><15-1,15-2*,15-3*,15-4*>] can you show me about [Est<28><15-1,15-2*,15-3*,15-4*>: this bright red dot Est<28><15-1,15-2*,15-3*,15-4*>] right [Est<28><15-1,15-2*,15-3*,15-4*>: here? Est<28><15-1,15-2*,15-3*,15-4*>]
It is looks like it is just north of Lake.
what would that street be?
That is do not know what that street is maybe
No it can not be.
What is causing these little white out squares?
so there may be data under there 
or it was just blocked out because there was no data under there 
right ok that is right 
we need to get you guys a cameo on a crime scene tv show 
it would be pretty cool 
could do a lot of forensics with this 
so what this is telling me is that somewhere in the hot spot that hot spot that we had two happened in december two happened on a sunday two happened between 12 midnight and 6 am and two happened in 2011 
is is that that red dot right there 
and are they all the same event 
the same two events 
so that bright red dot is is two homicides that happened on a sunday in december between 12 midnight and 6 in 2011 
so that suggests if that is the case if they were overlaid and that is why it all these others look like them because it is not as bright red it is just isolated one homicide 
We do not we would have to do another map to figure out when each of those or what year each of those homicides took place.
I know what let us do.
let us do that same this year 14.png 
let us just do that just for 2012 when we had this spike 
ok perfect this will be all we need 
can not really gather a lot of data about the homicides without i mean you have a lot of data about it but you would need a little bit more to really understand the context 
cause in this picture with that small data set that could be just you know a a murder suicide 
2012 ok that tells you a little bit not a whole lot pretty scattered it is like it is random 
social may be right 
i wonder if any of this is related to that re districting of gangs 
that would be an event data to look at right cause they redrew the maps and they moved kids around from gangs from school to school and created just a big mess 
alright what else what else you want me to tell you say out loud what or do you have enough 
this feels fun i mean this feels great 
you have been excellent data analysis experts 
good listening good categorization skills very good 
ok yeah thank you 
fascinating what you can do
