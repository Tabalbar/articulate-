alright let me think here.
I think I want to I think I want to start off simple and try to get more detailed from there.
So starting off I would just like to see [Est<1><01>: the total amount Est<1><01>] of [Est<1><01>: crimes Est<1><01>] that happened divided by [Est<1><01>: the three main areas Est<1><01>] [Est<1><01>: the UIC Est<1><01>] [Est<1><01>: River North Est<1><01>] and [Est<1><01>: Near West Side. Est<1><01>]
Just cause I am thinking you know to get it started.
It is kind of a problem actually.
What is ? Do we know what that definition is or? ok here we go.
What is ? Do we know what that definition is or? ok here we go.
Ok River North Ok.
is there any way to see kind of a similar division between the four neighborhoods but also track it over i think it is 2010 like by year from the dataset 2010 to 2014 or whatever it is 
See if anything has changed. Or if there is any trend overall.
Ok. that is an I guess somewhat positive sign.
Ok so is there any way starting let me think.
so is there anyway starting off to see what i wan the division of the crime types is in the most recent dataset in 2014 
Then we will see what [Text<5><03>: that Text<5><03>] shows and maybe moving on from there it might be good to see trends on [Text<6><03>: that Text<6><03>] too.
Ok so [Text<7><03>: it Text<7><03>] looks like I guess kind of what you would expect actually.
ok is there any way ok i am thinking thinking out loud there is kind of two to look at this 
You can look at it as theft.
or first of all I was really trying thinking of looking at it as a trend over time for [Text<8><02,03>: both of them Text<8><02,03>] but the effect seems pretty overwhelming right now so I am kind of looking thinking of doing looking more into that.
Is there [Est<9><04>: any way Est<9><04>] to kind of show [Est<9><04>: theft Est<9><04>] by [Est<9><04>: location type? Est<9><04>]
Cause then it might be kind of great in terms of figuring out where to put people in terms of police officers.
I guess that makes sense actually.
Ok so streets and apartment stores so ok.
So we know ok.
First starting off [Est<10><05>: around what time of day Est<10><05>] do [Est<10><05>: the thefts Est<10><05>] usually occur in in general?
Ok. Ok so ok so already we are thinking that it is kind it is kind of somewhat obvious but at the same time like that the most crime is theft on the street particularly in 12 noon to 6 PM time.
now the data doing that with the dataset its gps coordinates is where the crimes are listed gps instead of addresses 
would be it would be good to know there if there is some way to visualize to know like kind of based on where we know where the crimes what the kind if there is a general area where it lights up more but like in terms of like gps based on gps coordinate if there is certain certain area of physical like areas where it is more likely to happen 
not sure how easy that would be to visualize 
ok alright thank you 
i think that would be a thing because in terms of you know officers on the ground obviously knowing the actual general kind of hot spots and locations based on the gps 
Especially for something like theft which is arguably something that could be affected by having more patrols and more police officers.
So [Est<13><06*>: [Text<11*><06*>: it Text<11*><06*>] Est<13><06*>] looks can you make [Est<13><06*>: [Text<12*><06*>: it Text<12*><06*>] Est<13><06*>] [Est<13><06*>: a little bit Est<13><06*>] bigger?
Thanks I can see [Text<14*><06*>: it. Text<14*><06*>] It looks like State street.
ok so i guess that kind of makes sense 
ok so now we know that for in terms of theft and in terms of the general dataset overall state street and a few other areas are kind of like hot spots 
Looks like a little bit around Magnificent Mile or Chicago Avenue.
Now is I guess overall has there been any is there what I am thinking about what I want to think about is if there is been [Est<15><07-1,07-2,07-3,07-4,07-5>: any change Est<15><07-1,07-2,07-3,07-4,07-5>] in [Est<15><07-1,07-2,07-3,07-4,07-5>: terms Est<15><07-1,07-2,07-3,07-4,07-5>] of has [Est<15><07-1,07-2,07-3,07-4,07-5>: one area Est<15><07-1,07-2,07-3,07-4,07-5>] historically not been [Est<15><07-1,07-2,07-3,07-4,07-5>: a problem Est<15><07-1,07-2,07-3,07-4,07-5>] and then has recently had [Est<15><07-1,07-2,07-3,07-4,07-5>: any kind Est<15><07-1,07-2,07-3,07-4,07-5>] of [Est<15><07-1,07-2,07-3,07-4,07-5>: drastic difference Est<15><07-1,07-2,07-3,07-4,07-5>] either good or bad
In [Est<16><07-1,07-2,07-3,07-4,07-5>: terms Est<16><07-1,07-2,07-3,07-4,07-5>] of I guess since we are talking about [Est<16><07-1,07-2,07-3,07-4,07-5>: theft Est<16><07-1,07-2,07-3,07-4,07-5>] we will stay focused on that but that is it would be good to know if [Est<16><07-1,07-2,07-3,07-4,07-5>: certain areas Est<16><07-1,07-2,07-3,07-4,07-5>] are starting to b more problematic overall.
ok yeah no that is perfect.
That is actually ok yeah.
if we had a dataset that if [Text<17*><06*>: the dataset Text<17*><06*>] had a lot of kind of like more from what we know about what the most popular crimes were if the most popular crimes somehow were things like deceptive practice then maybe we would want to take out some of those because that would not be good for patrols like since basically the vast majority of what the data shows is kind of standard kind of crime that would be affected by police officers.
i think having the general crime map is actually pretty good 
yeah if you could about any changes overall 
yeah that would be great 
because i know that i mean i am not sure exactly how much things change over time but over four years there is quite possibly different business demographics changes things like that so 
ok so that is good for the general kind of what the hot spots are 
ok ok so that is kind of good for just general 
if we wanted let me think about this 
ok so so now we know that general hot spots for crime the general trends the kind of most popular crimes 
ok let us talk so if we are thinking since theft is the biggest crime let us kind of and that is you know what we have kind of that we talked about first.
let us kind of look at let us look at something slightly different 
let us look at just overall not by year but just overall the number of recorded narcotics violations by geography 
Ok alright so [Text<19><08>: that Text<19><08>] is definitely looks slightly different distribution.
Ok alright so that would be useful to know too.
ok so that is kind of that is kind of a good way to look at it.
I trying think if there is any kind of more or clever ways that we can look at the data that maybe are not as standard.
let us ok so let us say ok bear with me on this one I just want to try something here.
let us say I know that some of these areas have some have a lot of not I mean I guess they are usually more West than this but some of these areas do have a lot of empty lots which I thought I saw on here but I do not know a vacant lot.
Is there [Est<20><09>: any way Est<20><09>] to see what kind of [Est<20><09>: crimes Est<20><09>] tend to be in [Est<20><09>: vacant lots? Est<20><09>]
Ok that is interesting ok.
ok alright that is that is really interesting.
How about on the CTA the CTA bus garage or let us do CTA CTA CTA bus and CTA train.
you found some ok.
I was kind of just curious about that.
I am not sure if I have too much to go down on that path.
can we do [Est<22><10-1*,10-2>: [Text<21><09>: the same thing Text<21><09>] Est<22><10-1*,10-2>] for [Est<22><10-1*,10-2>: CTA bus Est<22><10-1*,10-2>] and [Est<22><10-1*,10-2>: CTA train? Est<22><10-1*,10-2>]
I am trying to think if I want to go anywhere with [Text<23><10-1*,10-2>: that Text<23><10-1*,10-2>] but I am kind of drawing a blank.
we can tar  no.
let us let us kind of go a diff go a different way now and let us talk about homicides 
ok now pull up the homicide map 
ok is there can i also see a see homicides by month if that is possible 
ok at least in this part of the city a little bit different from what i might think or kind of a little bit different from what people tend to think because usually they tend to think of a much bigger spike around july august and there is definitely some activity then but it seems like may is up there 
i mean there is not too many homicides since they are relative to others 
can you make the narcotics map and put it up next to this 
ok and while we are at it just for the sake of can you put the theft map up 
ok so i guess what we are seeing here is not entirely unexpected 
we see a lot of thefts particularly in downtown and river north area are a lot of stores and tourists and just lots of people in general whereas when you the see the list of murder and narcotics map is somewhat more in other areas like near little village and over by western kind of west of the medical district and the tri taylor area 
Ok so [Text<25><11>: that Text<25><11>] is good information in terms of knowing exactly you know kind of knowing where to put certain kinds of you know like street patrols and things like that probably downtown where there is a lot of people but also if you are looking into the end of high crime and drugs then you would be looking into the South and like Near South Near West.
Is there [Est<30><14-1,14-2*,14-3>: any way Est<30><14-1,14-2*,14-3>] between [Est<30><14-1,14-2*,14-3>: [Text<26><08,11,13*>: the three Text<26><08,11,13*>] Est<30><14-1,14-2*,14-3>] [Est<30><14-1,14-2*,14-3>: [Text<27><08>: the narcotics Text<27><08>] Est<30><14-1,14-2*,14-3>] [Est<30><14-1,14-2*,14-3>: [Text<28><11>: homicides Text<28><11>] Est<30><14-1,14-2*,14-3>] and [Est<30><14-1,14-2*,14-3>: [Text<29*><13*>: thefts Text<29*><13*>] Est<30><14-1,14-2*,14-3>] is there [Est<30><14-1,14-2*,14-3>: any way Est<30><14-1,14-2*,14-3>] to do it by [Est<30><14-1,14-2*,14-3>: time of day Est<30><14-1,14-2*,14-3>] and by [Est<30><14-1,14-2*,14-3>: large area Est<30><14-1,14-2*,14-3>] like one of [Est<30><14-1,14-2*,14-3>: the four areas. Est<30><14-1,14-2*,14-3>]
yes by [Est<31><14-3>: time of day. Est<31><14-3>]
alright so overall evening and afternoon spike in both theft and narcotics slightly different pattern between the two 
it looks like there is a lot of theft going on in river north ok 
alright so putting it all together we would kind of have an idea of where to send police officers in that regard and kind of look in terms of narcotics and theft 
there is not too homicides is overall not a huge number but it is definitely sort of a cluster in some areas 
so i am trying to think that kind of gives us a lot of useful information and i am just trying to think if there would i am looking at the location types trying to think if there is any particular one that i would want to look at besides we already looked at cta we looked at vacant lots but i do not know if i do not know how useful it would be to do some of these 
yeah i think have pretty useful information overall 
i guess one thing is there i guess just as a kind of to make sure there is not some kind of trend that we are missing 
Is there any way to I know I think we have done some similar things as this already with I think we already did the number of crimes over the years for the three or four things that we were we did it by area that is right.
is there [Est<32><15-1,15-2*>: any way Est<32><15-1,15-2*>] to kind of just do [Est<32><15-1,15-2*>: a trend Est<32><15-1,15-2*>] of [Est<32><15-1,15-2*>: the type of crime Est<32><15-1,15-2*>] over [Est<32><15-1,15-2*>: the last four years? Est<32><15-1,15-2*>]
Ok [Text<33><15-1,15-2*>: that Text<33><15-1,15-2*>] does not look like there is any huge spikes in anything.
Alright so [Text<34><15-1,15-2*>: this Text<34><15-1,15-2*>] is good.
Alright in terms yeah I think [Text<35><15-1,15-2*>: that Text<35><15-1,15-2*>] answers a lot of questions all at once.
theft and battery would mostly be things that if they would happen on the street when your patrols it would still be kind of doing the same patrols probably in similar areas and a lot of the ones that would not be things that a patrol would catch would be things that would have to be called in anyway.
And then a lot of the there is a lot a lot of these crimes do not have very huge numbers behind them.
just because it tends to be [Est<36><16>: a another thing Est<36><16>] that can like [Est<36><16>: cluster Est<36><16>] somewhere I guess it would probably be useful to see [Est<36><16>: a prostitution map. Est<36><16>]
Ok that is kind of interesting.
Ok and then I guess there is not too much more to say about [Text<37><16>: the prostitution map. Text<37><16>]
i mean it is just good information 
One thing actually let me look at the crime types [Text<38><15-1,15-2*>: here. Text<38><15-1,15-2*>]
It would be good to know so kind of like the same thing with theft in terms of where does it happen both like where in on the map but also like what kind of location.
especially since we are dealing with fairly large geographical area and a college area it might be good besides the usual point of the map which is apparently my favorite thing.
it might be good to pull up [Est<39><17-1,17-2*>: a map Est<39><17-1,17-2*>] and see where [Est<39><17-1,17-2*>: the most reports Est<39><17-1,17-2*>] are for [Est<39><17-1,17-2*>: sexual assault Est<39><17-1,17-2*>] or I guess it is sex offense is what it is listed under.
And if we are thinking in terms of how I am not privy to how the Chicago Police Department works but most police departments have divisions on homicide and they obviously have beat cops they have homicide divisions they have sexual assault divisions they sometimes have prostitution they always have drug divisions too so that is kind of why I am going through these main categories in my head.
ok so that is definitely where some of the crimes are i mean are a little bit more localized and it is a little bit more diffuse 
we do still see like some variance in where it happens in terms of location type 
It is kind of difficult to say because since sexual offense probably can mean a lot of things.
It is unclear on if you know what kind of offenses we are dealing with.
is there is there any way to show or either we can do it by map or by area but maybe by map would be easier.
Is there [Est<40><18>: any way Est<40><18>] to of the is there [Est<40><18>: any way Est<40><18>] to narrow it narrow it down by [Est<40><18>: ones Est<40><18>] that happen in [Est<40><18>: street Est<40><18>] or [Est<40><18>: alley Est<40><18>] or [Est<40><18>: sidewalk? Est<40><18>]
Alright so we kind of covered that.
can not think of other ways to look at this 
Did actually I thought in my mind I think I thought I asked this but actually I do not think I did.
if I did me but did can I see [Est<41><19>: number Est<41><19>] of [Est<41><19>: crimes Est<41><19>] [Est<41><19>: all crimes Est<41><19>] via [Est<41><19>: location type? Est<41><19>]
Ok that is what I alright.
And now I am asking this mostly because of since we have kind of covered just the general areas that is probably the most important thing.
And kind of divided by crime it just would be interesting to see if certain just general locations.
I mean obviously street and sidewalk came up but there is other things that would be more surprising so the department stores have a pretty high number but we are also dealing with the downtown area so that is probably not u
ok i do not think there is any forest preserve in this area which makes sense 
alright now let me see here 
so i am just looking to see what location types have crime here 
i am trying to remind myself if some of these things exist in this area 
And then so now I guess since we have covered the kind of the general stuff let us just quickly think about UIC in general since they do have their own kind of.
   police and security kind of thing going on.
is there anyway to pull up [Est<42><20>: the number Est<42><20>] of [Est<42><20>: type of crime Est<42><20>] at [Est<42><20>: UIC Est<42><20>] just overall I guess?
Ok so kind of an ongoing trend [Text<43><20>: here. Text<43><20>]
ok so overall i think that answered most of my questions so those kinds of things we would be interested in would be you know kind of predicting what the answer would be but what kind of crime is most likely to happen if i own a restaurant in this area 
Yeah that is interesting.
Alright I think that I have covered most of what I would want to ask.
And [Est<44><22>: the only other thing Est<44><22>] that I probably did not quite cover is if there is I guess [Est<44><22>: the rate of crime Est<44><22>] in general by [Est<44><22>: day of the week. Est<44><22>]
Ok so that is pretty constant.
Is there [Est<47><23-2,23-3*>: a way Est<47><23-2,23-3*>] to divide [Est<47><23-2,23-3*>: [Text<45><22>: it Text<45><22>] Est<47><23-2,23-3*>] up kind of like we did with [Est<47><23-2,23-3*>: the number Est<47><23-2,23-3*>] of [Est<47><23-2,23-3*>: [Text<46><15-1,15-2*>: crimes? Text<46><15-1,15-2*>] Est<47><23-2,23-3*>]
Well I guess in [Est<48><23-1*,23-2,23-3*>: any way Est<48><23-1*,23-2,23-3*>] divide it up in [Est<48><23-1*,23-2,23-3*>: terms Est<48><23-1*,23-2,23-3*>] of you know [Est<48><23-1*,23-2,23-3*>: number Est<48><23-1*,23-2,23-3*>] of [Est<48><23-1*,23-2,23-3*>: crimes Est<48><23-1*,23-2,23-3*>] [Est<48><23-1*,23-2,23-3*>: day of the week Est<48><23-1*,23-2,23-3*>] but divide it up by [Est<48><23-1*,23-2,23-3*>: crime type? Est<48><23-1*,23-2,23-3*>]
[Text<49><23-1*,23-2,23-3*>: that Text<49><23-1*,23-2,23-3*>] is really nice ok.
Alright so there is not too many I guess real significant things except for probably an increase in battery and criminal damage on the weekends Saturday and Sunday.
ok that is really interesting 
and theft goes up on friday too 
that is a little bit unusual ok 
i think that is a lot of good information
