I should probably look at let us start with [Est<1><01-1*,01-2>: the activity Est<1><01-1*,01-2>] around [Est<1><01-1*,01-2>: UIC? Est<1><01-1*,01-2>]
Is is it working? Is it moving?
Just saying out my thoughts.
It is processing so it is working.
This thing is all sorting so.
let us see city is specifically aiming to deploy additional law enforcement resources to and deter crime and need to know which areas to deploy the officers 
there is two of them 
so many pink ones 
let us see what it says here 
heat map showing crime hot spots all crimes only red 
so the pink means that it is more minimal red means it is pretty hot 
so we are looking around harrison ashland roosevelt it is not that bad 
except closer to roosevelt and south canal the heck is goin on around there 
and roosevelt and ashland 
let us see what is this one here 
heat map showing crime hot spots all crimes just uic 
ok this is what i am looking for 
the sum of number of crimes i think right yeah 
again pink is small red is the hot spot ok 
what is this again 
[Text<2*><01-1*>: That Text<2*><01-1*>] is all neighborhoods [Text<3><01-2>: this Text<3><01-2>] is specifically just UIC.
I am looking at Canal and Roosevelt.
That one is really hot!
Wait what what metro is that? That one right there. That one is really really red. I can not see with the dots in the way though. What metro is that?
It is not neighborhoods.
Is it Jackson Boulevard?
let us see can i alter this ok 
yeah I want to take a look closer to the metro right here a little bit eastward of Greektown.
That is like right by the river.
you can not zoom in.
Ok that is fine.
Alright cool because that is a funky spot.
Crime is right there at the metro.
at the i wait no el metro 
am i getting these trains mixed up 
but yeah around uic we will probably have to focus around canal actually 
roosevelt is got its problems but canal is got its bigger problems 
everything else is more dispersed 
so around here around what is this this is cool 
more transparent that is great 
adams this would what are those 
that is a bus stop 
yeah that is a bus stop 
a bus stop near greektown 
i am not going to know the number of that 
unless there is a chance of zooming in 
but that street is specifically jackson boulevard i think 
it is still canal anyways 
right next to the freeway 
so along around uic we are looking along canal and roosevelt 
so we want to do some routine searches through that yeah 
so so it just seems like it is around the perimeter more 
it is like a box of everything else dots in the middle but we got most of it on the border 
so we go border wise around it then 
that would definitely be what we should do when it to the officers 
it is probably the smaller streets that does it 
no it is all along the main ones yeah ok 
I think I got this one for UIC where to deploy officers would be around the perimeter this looks like East Campus.
Alright then let us take [Est<5><03>: a look Est<5><03>] I am curious about [Est<5><03>: River North? Est<5><03>] [Est<5><03>: The activity Est<5><03>] around [Est<5><03>: River North Est<5><03>] and in it?
This is so cool look at it go.
Goodbye [Text<7><01-1*,01-2,02*,02-2>: adult maps Text<7><01-1*,01-2,02*,02-2>] you have b [Text<8><01-1*,01-2,02*,02-2>: baby maps. Text<8><01-1*,01-2,02*,02-2>]
[Text<9><01-2>: That one Text<9><01-2>] is a teenager.
it is the dot is are not as red but it is definitely red around Chicago Avenue.
So it is more focused around there not surprised since that is like shopping and everything.
So nice place to break in stuff I guess.
Often very populated so I am not sure who has the guts to go doing that.
Except let us see I spent an all nighter once.
But around 4 AM no.
downtown trickles down around 3 and then everyone starts trickling in around 6 
but yeah definitely around chicago avenue magnificent mile keep calling it the millenium mile what the heck was i thinking 
wow around the child museum too 
it is not as bad but it is orange 
it is a child museum i would be concerned a water infiltration plant too that does not sound healthy 
i wonder what is going on with ontario and ohio 
so let us see if i were to deploy officers for here i would have to average them out for where things are more going to likely get hit 
so i would say get a few up there we can go ziggy zaggy down possibly 
that ontario spot is throwing me off because i would go zig zag down and then go to the right make a little bit of a turn around the museum because i am always concerned about children and then go back around 
maybe there is another way i could that because this is like i am picking the best route to to send officers out possibly on just a routine patrol instead of you know go out on a hunt 
ok hold on wait i think yeah ok i think we got it 
we would go probably like it would look like a fire a little flame that would tip up here then we go down go along go down the magnificent mile and then loop up back around 
because i think that child museum is close enough to the magnificent mile 
so we go down and around and back up 
so it is a loop within the loop 
alright so that is what i would conclude with 
and then i want to try the loop 
definitely going to need you for later that is for sure 
let us look at this 
it is a freaking straight line right down there what is going on with you state 
state you bad you very bad 
i think that is pretty much what we would probably do right there 
So for UIC I am saying we do the perimeter for River North we would do a Loop within it over here it seems we go along State because that is where it is concentrated yeah.
Well that was a lot quicker than I thought ok.
let me see [Est<10><05>: the activity Est<10><05>] for [Est<10><05>: Near West Side. Est<10><05>]
I feel so official this is great!
I have to look at crime types later.
and whether to do varied deployment depending on time of day day of the week month of the year 
so right now i am looking at a more general kind of look 
and then ok i can work with that all the details 
ok what is going on with wicker park 
ok so we got some kind of parallelogram going on here 
it is just that one line on the el what el goes through this through wicker park 
what is it with you 
What street is that? that is Damen! I drove through Damen!
Ok so I can probably see the setting.
Setting that looks very deteriorated I will say.
but we got a problem up on this line a problem up on that line.
The one up on West Division and the one up on the 64 it looks like.
And then we got everything around it is pink and then we got red dot.
Wonder what happened might have to look at the details.
I wonder if I could look at [Est<11><06-1*,06-2,06-3*,06-4*>: just the general type of crime Est<11><06-1*,06-2,06-3*,06-4*>] that occurs in [Est<11><06-1*,06-2,06-3*,06-4*>: Near West. Est<11><06-1*,06-2,06-3*,06-4*>]
That might make my decision a lot better because [Text<12><05>: this one Text<12><05>] is more spaced out.
So I will look at that later.
From this angle if I just using Keller theory I should be on the money with UIC.
yep and then over in river north it is pretty tear droppy from my near sightedness 
i do not have my glasses on right now but i should still be able to see very well 
it looks like a diamond from near near west and the loop i can not tell from over here except the one freaking red dot i can pick out from the pink 
that is one thing i have to remember 
can not drive without my glasses 
because how my eyes work without them is i see colors which interpret into shapes but i can not see shapes specifically so i imply everything 
yes this is good too 
lots of theft battery is bad 
well ok theft is very general 
theft happens in all of them 
i am not really too particularly surprised because theft in general is well theft can range from stealing paper from the printer room to big old break in 
that also includes trespassing 
let us see so the loop has problem with deceptive practice 
deceptive practice we talking like fraud or something 
Is that what deceptive practice ok.
Ask the in room aid alright.
Hi when it says deceptive practice are we talking fraud?
yeah that is definitely fraud then ok thank you 
Ok so the Loop has fraud problems ok.
not too surprised it is the bottom of the magnificent mile and not exactly the safest place i think right no i do not know that is just me 
near west battery criminal damage and burglary let us see how that looks 
so my look on the general map and number obviously does not account for arson because arson does not appear twenty times everywhere so 
hope i did let us see right up there 
there is arson right there 
and then deceptive practice i am a little concerned about the arson that is just that is freaking sex offense all the way on the bottom of that place along ogden what the heck is going on over there 
ok so near west has a lot of problems but it seems the top 3 outside of theft is battery criminal damage and burglary 
and then everything yeah and then more theft of motor vehicle 
river north has problems with battery deceptive practice ok yeah 
and uic battery criminal damage and then we got assault deceptive practice and narcotics 
which is almost as leveled as other offenses and motor vehicle theft 
alright number of crimes by crime type all neighborhoods lots of battery 
so do i want to 
arson may be really bad but it does a lot more rare than the others 
so if we want to catch some we need to catch it for its frequency 
and the reason why there is a frequency is because of something within the areas typically the settings and the culture within the areas 
that is why i hear a lot of bad things about the west side and uic is like it is ok 
yeah arson is pretty bad but that is like trying to catch a fairy every now and again 
so we if the officers do across the arsonists that is pretty cool but we can not just focus on that 
so i but i should atleast give into consideration where the arson does happen so it is more like the concentration of the area or the density of what kind of stuff that does happen so let us see 
down here we have sex offense we have some stalking death happens too often for my taste 
holy cow what the heck ok so prostitution up the wazoo here 
is that public peace violation that is more on the down low so definitely not something to think on 
offense involving children i will slap the person 
but got to think on more 
and then so lot is of sex offense around here 
arson is concentrated right here and then everywhere else is prostitution 
lot is of them 
ok what is the frequency of prostitution here 
not too much that is river north i would not be too surprised very little 
that is uic campus if there was any prostitution we would be in trouble trouble trouble trouble 
prostitution does not appear as much either so i can well it is not really in my book prostitution as a crime does not have the level of intensity as other things at the moment 
yeah so that is all the orange 
i would never do sex offense honestly no mi gusta 
i am totally going everywhere 
why is it that that spot is a lot it is a lot red er so that means it is it is got a lot of crimes but the crimes the number is not it is not the because with the type of crime 
ok that is what i am tryin to say 
so it is more like we are looking up it is like crescent almost going from near 64 further west and curve it down all the way over here and then what is that is like a line of theft so i wonder what is going on there 
because like prostitution seems like it is more focused here 
i mean that southern border is nasty but that is why we need to patrol that spot 
so we are around there and back up kind of like a g 
i think that would be pretty good 
go around up and a little bit in 
because if if we just leave the area like not patrol then that is where it is going to focus 
because if you am not looking there then they are going to hide there 
let us see yeah 
So Near West I would conclude that we would do hold on.
There is [Est<13><07-1*,07-2,07-3*,07-4*>: information Est<13><07-1*,07-2,07-3*,07-4*>] for [Est<13><07-1*,07-2,07-3*,07-4*>: time of the year Est<13><07-1*,07-2,07-3*,07-4*>] for [Est<13><07-1*,07-2,07-3*,07-4*>: deployment. Est<13><07-1*,07-2,07-3*,07-4*>] Could I take [Est<13><07-1*,07-2,07-3*,07-4*>: a look Est<13><07-1*,07-2,07-3*,07-4*>] at [Est<13><07-1*,07-2,07-3*,07-4*>: when crimes Est<13><07-1*,07-2,07-3*,07-4*>] happen?
And then I continue looking around here.
There is a diamond there but what happens there that West side of Near West that needs help. Yeah. Definitely a G there.
that is a good spot because i will still be looking at these 
it is always nice to have multiple screens up and available for me to look at because i like things if i am looking for information 
blue dots them blue dots not good 
so looking at the time now 
right now i am kind of just looking at hot spots 
Significant changes in crime patterns.
Are we talking like different settings?
Hello! Ok this spot where it says that significant changes in crime patterns are we talking more like changes due to crime setting or changes over time?
alright let us look 
We are looking at number of crimes per year in all neighborhoods by per month.
so is decreasing well that is good at least we are seeing like a slope down 
this is really wonky 
down from january that is a holiday 
you are going to get a lot of tourists so you are going to get a lot of people jipped 
that is really sad but it is the truth 
especially when they are new to an area and they are very naive 
february crimes per why is it february 
is it because everyone is in the jewelry store 
i do not know 
you do not know 
because like if there is more people there then i do not know if you want to show your mug there 
so then it goes up obviously during the warmer months because that is when everyone out 
but august and september those two are i what the no that is there month after they are close to the fiscal i think right 
it is either june or july i 
but there is definitely a time when when the when children almost everyone who is pursuing goes back to and then if I am talking more of the family unit parents are at work children are at school around that time or getting ready so houses get broken?
i do not know 
Because like [Est<14><08-1,08-2*,08when-3*,08-4*>: number Est<14><08-1,08-2*,08when-3*,08-4*>] of [Est<14><08-1,08-2*,08when-3*,08-4*>: crimes Est<14><08-1,08-2*,08when-3*,08-4*>] [Est<14><08-1,08-2*,08when-3*,08-4*>: a lot Est<14><08-1,08-2*,08when-3*,08-4*>] of these would account for [Est<14><08-1,08-2*,08when-3*,08-4*>: theft Est<14><08-1,08-2*,08when-3*,08-4*>] so I am assuming [Est<14><08-1,08-2*,08when-3*,08-4*>: a lot Est<14><08-1,08-2*,08when-3*,08-4*>] of these are for [Est<14><08-1,08-2*,08when-3*,08-4*>: theft. Est<14><08-1,08-2*,08when-3*,08-4*>] Unless I could look at them by [Est<14><08-1,08-2*,08when-3*,08-4*>: different crime types. Est<14><08-1,08-2*,08when-3*,08-4*>]
Like individually like because I know theft is going to be big.
but i wonder like when battery wants to take place 
let us do that 
my neighbors are noisy on friday i have to call the guard to get them to shut up 
i am not surprised 
number of crimes by hour of the day 
yeah see wait no what 
they are more later than they are earlier 
i would have thought 3 to 6 in the morning 
because that is when nobody wants to go out 
so i guess these criminals are i do not know 
from 12 to so from noon to evening noon is when they strike the most 
goodness that is kind of scary 
wait wait a minute 
no 12 noon would make sense 
a lot of people would be out for sure but it is not like they do not have no places to hide 
and then this when most people are too busy to like focus on anything 
let us take a look at this 
lots of deceptive practice yeah 
so funny there is a what is it a on the bottom 
those are ok yeah 
good god the number of sex offense it is pretty leveled out 
deceptive practice is pretty rotten 
well yeah during the summer that is when you try to get everyone everyone is out might as well knock them out in one blow 
from 12 noon till then ok 
hey would i be able to take a restroom break 
would i need to remove this stuff 
alright let us see where i want to send off the popo 
ok let us see 
so everywhere seems to be a lot of fraud 
i wonder if that is that is a bad crime but is it the crime i want my cops to go after or focus on 
because there is a lot of other things these just happen to occur pretty high prostitutions after that 
this is by year by day by day of the week ok 
by it is just nice to look and see that things are getting little bit under control which is nice 
and then by month 
only around the hotter days 
i am also concerned about the children when they are heading back so between june and september be like a nice little increase of stuff of cop activity 
just to match it 
and maybe fluctuate a little because once you b predictable there b a problem and a fight 
from 12 noon till almost 12 midnight which surprises me 
because i just know like in pittsburgh the streets are empty at 2 am 
so empty you can right through it 
ok and then the end of the week which i am not surprised either 
that is what just the is just the beginning so i guess it is like from thursday to monday it would be nice to have those weekends increase of patrols or something 
during the day mainly focus on yeah see like till 3 am that is prostitution 
you know what is going on around 3 am 
everything else kind of leveled out that is why i am not making a big decision on them even though there is sex offense which i utterly totally hate 
but yeah ok just seems like where am i going to find more mountains because we are not liking these mountains 
9 oclock has some weird spikes what happens at 9 wait that is when everyone is in the street going to work 
and then the el is like so freaking ew 
wait what is that second purple line again 
wait that is theft 
which one is theft 
if i remember from the other charts for one of those colors are way too close in shade unless it is the screen 
which i can not tell 
no they are the same shape 
yeah is the lower of the purple the deceptive practice or is it the higher one 
see i i noticed the movement 
that is one thing it is like having a little bird by and be like hey look at me 
I am starting to think I got the routes West side I do.
I got to look at the other ones later.
But I want to determine on times of day theft happens a lot from what [Text<15><07-1*,07-2,07-3*,07-4*>: the other graphs Text<15><07-1*,07-2,07-3*,07-4*>] say.
So I am wondering if [Est<17><09-1*,09-2,09-3*,09-4*>: the top purple line Est<17><09-1*,09-2,09-3*,09-4*>] is theft because then it will match [Est<17><09-1*,09-2,09-3*,09-4*>: the information Est<17><09-1*,09-2,09-3*,09-4*>] on [Est<17><09-1*,09-2,09-3*,09-4*>: [Text<16><07-1*,07-2,07-3*,07-4*>: the other graphs Text<16><07-1*,07-2,07-3*,07-4*>] Est<17><09-1*,09-2,09-3*,09-4*>] but I am not always sure?
Because like what is no a lot of these colors are similar or the same.
That might be troublesome.
Because like I was kind of interpreting that the fraud was like so high that everybody was doing it.
I mean I know I did it as a kid.
there we go. That helps a lot better.
So it was not the sex offense it was the criminal damage.
Yeah labeling definitely does help yes ok.
ok concealed license violation non criminal all that stuff happy days 
ok so theft occurs when everybody is out especially at 9 am when everybody is out 
because that is when you are booking for the train 
yeah because i was thinking more between 3 and 6 but is it because we got more cops out around that hour 
or is it what is going on between 3 and 6 
because everyone else is sc is like i am going to sleep at 2 and waking up at 7 atleast that is mine 
so at ok at 9 then at 12 noon what happens at 12 noon 
well that is lunch hour 
it is definitely rush hour 
ok my god theft between friday and saturday 
glad i am home between those times 
i would i do not pillow fight the thief 
let us see just got to make sure i have there is still a green light ok 
i do not want ok 
february dips down again 
such a for it to dip down 
especially because there is valentines day there is black history month 
what else happens in february 
something else does i do not know i can not remember 
so if for specific months i would focus from wait no hold on 
where would spikes be 
that is that is one thing i did not notice 
the amount is pretty high but they suddenly grow 
where are the spikes between february and march for this 
Got to find spikes that is why the 9 AM was so weird for me because spikes.
Let me do the last two ok done.
I I will have labels now. Thank you.
This is very helpful.
Ok so I do [Text<18*><09-3*>: not Text<18*><09-3*>] really need [Text<18*><09-3*>: the year Text<18*><09-3*>] anymore because from the looks of it we are doing something right and it is heading down.
Just hoping that 2015 does not spike because you know graphs numbers weird.
from midnight to 1 has a weird drop but 9 am definite spike 12 pm definite spike towards the evening when everyone is going is heading home 
because you hear a lot of stories of people heading home and finding someone has busted in 
1700 hours that is 5 pm so then ok 
so 5 12 noon and 9 but definitely between 12 noon and 9 have a steady patrol 
but 9 is really really off 
so definitely at 9 send out cops 
right at 9 so i can get on the el pretty safely 
why am i looking back at the years it is always nice to see things drop 
is that weird to spike on february 
yeah bye bye year 
i am good with the year thank you 
spike from february to march 
what happens between february and march besides valentines day 
or is it because of valentines day that it happens 
wait do stores have sales right after valetine is day 
kind of like how chocolates get sales 
i see you typing 
ok so from february to march i would say we need something to patrol that or maybe between january to march because january still has that no it decreases then 
ok yeah yeah yeah february to march then 
february to march starts increasing around may 
but it is generally averaged around june to the end of wait no till mid october 
because that is when the weather is nice and you are not drowning in snow 
so alright for day i am saying 9 9 12 noon to 5 
for month february to march and then june to mid october 
because of the whole like it is up there god that spikes so weird 
and from thursday till from thursday till sunday weekend patrols 
so weekend weekend patrols 9 am because it is the rush 12 to 5 because of the work hours is that why 
or is it the rush hour it is one of them something like that 
february to march because of that weird spike that concerns me 
that is theft too so a lotta of people are getting things stolen 
so i think i i i am settling the time yeah i am good on the time 
And I I got the G pattern I got for Near West.
So let me see the what kind of [Est<20><01-1>: crimes Est<20><01-1>] happen around [Est<20><01-1>: UIC. Est<20><01-1>] [Text<19><01-1>: [Est<20><01-1>: That map. Text<19><01-1>] Est<20><01-1>]
Because I am done with [Text<21*><09-3*>: the year Text<21*><09-3*>] I think I am done with [Text<21*><09-3*>: the time Text<21*><09-3*>] so.
Ok. [Text<22><01-1>: Whoo Text<22><01-1>] it is bigger!
Alright. So is [Text<23><01-1>: this Text<23><01-1>] the one you mean?
[Est<25><10-1*,10-2,10-3*,10-4*>: [Text<24><01-1>: this Text<24><01-1>] Est<25><10-1*,10-2,10-3*,10-4*>] is really helpful because I need to but it is much like I was doing with [Est<25><10-1*,10-2,10-3*,10-4*>: West Side Est<25><10-1*,10-2,10-3*,10-4*>] I would like [Est<25><10-1*,10-2,10-3*,10-4*>: the crime types Est<25><10-1*,10-2,10-3*,10-4*>] with [Est<25><10-1*,10-2,10-3*,10-4*>: the crime activity. Est<25><10-1*,10-2,10-3*,10-4*>]
It is a ball bouncing.
Interference with public officer ok.
Ok theft and burglary is burglary like more of the whole with trespassing?
And theft is like more aggressive force or something?
Because I had just noticed that.
Does not change too much atleast.
Could I have like [Est<26><11>: a hot spot map Est<26><11>] like kind of like that colorful one for [Est<26><11>: Near West side Est<26><11>] with [Est<26><11>: the blue dots Est<26><11>] too?
Thank you I shall take a look at [Text<27><10-1*,10-2,10-3*,10-4*>: these Text<27><10-1*,10-2,10-3*,10-4*>] by the hour.
9 theft that is when everyone in 
is that one for uic too 
no i do not think so that one is general 
ok yep that is because that one is 9-1 that one is 10-2 so 10-1 is also connected and then 10-3 and 10-4 
i am good at picking these things up 
alright this is great 
ok so what we got here 
we got theft and i think sex offense right 
it is very i do not know it is very spread out 
that is pretty tough to make a decision on and probably i would still say wait 
there are some arsons but arsons are not as frequent as the whole 
thank you there we go 
now random green dots arson arson arson arson arson 
wait it is that can that can not be prostitution because the map ok it is the battery 
there is got to be something done with those colors because it mixes me up 
especially because there is two different categories right there 
let us see ok and then down here 
lots of battery in the middle sex offense and criminal damage 
ok let me look at this criminal damage day of the week 
ok so that is more criminal damage than it is sex offense 
ok i woulda been really alert there because i am a woman 
a lot of criminal damage is right there and that is the medical district 
ok and let us see beyond there 
i thought it is supposed to be just these campus but i am reading maps wrong 
ok medical east all around we still got this funky stuff in the middle 
so where would i want to route this 
i said around the perimeter last time 
do i want to stick with that 
do i want to stick with that 
i would say so but instead of going black and white on this decision we will go around the perimeter but have a few that goes through the center 
because it it arson appears more around the perimeter so that is more like you know you need a bit ore force for that but the center could do with like several cars maybe a couple 
but not as intense as the others 
because it it is populated with students 
and the big thing you want to make sure is the students are safe especially if you have a department for uic specifically 
because that means the department could just take care of it because if the students are not safe it is on your head 
yeah ok so around the perimeter more concentrated for patrol but we should let some things slip in the middle in order to keep an eye on things in the center because i am not seeing more arson there i am seeing more what i would say crimes that require less force to apprehend 
let us see day of the week the weekends 
ok yeah so continue with weekend patrol 
tuesdays are a little weird but it is not as weird as the weekends so yeah 
and then the hours 9 freaking 9 9 and 12 noon until times still stay the same freaking weekends 
i am looking at the wrong one 
ok here we go 9 
9 12 noon it starts to drop at 5 so more of 9 and 12 noon concentrated here 
that is right right yeah that is right 
Ok still on the weekends and I would still assume summer months because that is when everyone is out.
could I take a look at [Text<28*><10-3*>: 10-3? Text<28*><10-3*>]
i think i have a general conclusion atleast 
yep but i think yeah alright yep 
So if I wanted to deploy officers it it almost seems like the whole city needs to be watched over for weekend patrol.
at least those four neighbourhoods specifically 
and then during those hours 9 am especially because of the rush 12 noon till 5 because i do not know what is going on at night 
apparently criminals are not wanting to out at night instead 
during the warmer months and february till march because that is always weird ok 
alright yeah so i think i have concluded for atleast two of the neighborhoods i am more confirmed on because i have looked at all of the maps which was really helpful 
it took a lot to decide because i am jumping between stories and that 
you were of great assistance
