can you make me a line chart of region. can you show me the correlation between diabetes and cardiovascular disease. you would normally go into this and look up how do you make a bar chart why is in my thumb how do i color the lines different colors and how do i you know instead you could just talk to the digital assistant and then it would generate it on the flight. it'll keep adding charts and then. so in the study i gave this i gave the participants. attribute the holiday window which is just the calling names of all the. it just describes the dataset using the column names. i have map is region are you familiar with like a csv file. so there's specific data values that the participants could use to filter dated their data sets are in region there's a bunch of snowmen do at night to use and it also indicates it on the chart has the midwest so if the participants were talking about prioritizing resources for the midwest and then they can seltzer it so if i said. can you show me a diabetes rate for the southeast. so i didn't do it it's a butt. you see how we were talking about the midwest. we didn't switch to the ass already can you filter it by the midwest but because we were mentioning it so much already thought that that was an important email filter location. so it's not filtered by midwest and we also maybe discuss the region. cuz you're talking about all the different regions right. you have any cash. purpose of the user study. already can. i say we wanted to compare weather using conversational data was beneficial right so how do we do that. i made it so already generates a chart based on what the user explicitly asked it. and another chart based on what he thinks is the most important chart so potentially create to charts one using conversational data and one that doesn't. when the participants see those two charts generated there going to be no you're going to have to decide who i want to conversational one or two especially one and then if we choose express at 1. that means. we shouldn't use our digital citizenship to be emo listening to our conversation all day that conversation. so we end up you know they go through the whole study and try to answer the questions in the task and then we count upon my charts day of the select and then there's actually one thing for my thesis right now. 7 sessions. and then this pink line artist pink bar sorry this is how much charge do regenerated explicitly so that we can't believe they made about like 22 and this is how much they selected just talked about 20 of them. and other case we call this the implicit charts it was using a conversation with you that it generated like 40. that's 50/50 charts but it also acted like the same amount so you know. it was even. 50-50 second session. a sad one third session explicit one first session if it's someone buy a lot and then 4567 implicit one by just a little bit. so. yeah yeah yeah. so this shows that me know. the participants are selecting a insurance so there's some useful or advantages there and then in the rest of my paper i'm just explaining. why was this beneficial. i lost my messaging. so the participants also had dad two questions in their task one of them was where you want to prioritize for resources the second one was what interesting patterns can you find in the dealership and they were giving 25 minutes for each question and then at the end of each question i get in 5 minutes to explain their answer to me and talk to it. after the essentially one hour was up. i going to this page and this is just like a summary of everything the participants the same so this is the transcript are they collected and by the time i opened up this program it was already transcribing everything. this is a great cloud of all the mentioned words through with me and you were just passing through saying region a bunch of times. that's why region isn't that the biggest and it's continuing to come pick her up. this long tight here is. number of the attributes stover in the attribute table. this is there is region and in a bunch of matt bell daily percentage so. which can be seem like they're here can you make a bar chart of region. increase the count of bar chart sorry region 4 in our second sentence. increment there. no i'm using the web speech api so you just saw. can i just like plug-and-play just called use the library and turn it on and then everything. so the way that my method works. is i'm just basically making something called a sentence window. so i'm i set up the back in do you know a web interface programming or other natural language processing things but i send the transcript to the back in and it just takes the last five sentences the participants set. it sees or it tries to look for. and said a certain attribute or filter. this is done in the back end and then yeah and then i send the results back to the front end and then i'll view them for the user and then already receives it and he just he puts it on this week. conveyor belt unaudited ever went to genki sushi. no, they're about to go so this is our conveyor about notes sushi but instead of sushi it's visualizations. yeah i know the back under snowed in the front end is freezing the library card react. ciroc makes it really easy to manipulate the elements on the front end. so we're working with chicago and their natural language processing experts there. so when we did the study didn't have their cold ready in time but i already had like a prototype of mine working so we we did a user study with michael but now they have their code ready right now i'm in the process of trying to link everything together and they're going to be conducting another user study using the same exact interface but with their brains are you familiar with and i'll be techniques right so they're using. i think they're just developed a better cord reference resolution. okay so they're using. is it better to match. so in the sentence anna is a graduate student and ut dallas. there's two entities there and then when you say another sentence after this sentence you say she what is she referring to. so they developed a method. yeah named entity recognition but. transfer solution. i didn't mean entity recognition is extracting you know anna and youtube. call reference resolution is referencing. so if they have their whole system doing that now and now i'm trying to put it into articulate. it's pretty much just have any questions about our tea. reading the papers. yeah. yeah. let's look at the papers that i sent you. okay so this literature review is really helpful and just. he probably did her literature review before. it basically goes through all the message that the. the other researchers use in order to make the eight others lies ations from 2010 to. ewing's original paper. jason started this particular project back in 2010 it would have been earlier but the. jason was right and then they submitted another proposal saying you know you're siri and all can we make can we go forward with this project idea so they said yes and it created the first articulate which is just basically it was like one of the first the first of its kind greeting to the visitation cuz it was so new. i wasn't popular as it is now. in 2013. i think that's when they conducted a study that to show 2010 is when they come back to this study to show participants using excel spreadsheets to create data visualization and talking to a computer to create it and they found that the participants obviously enjoyed talking to the computer more degrees was it was faster and allow them to think more about what part of the deal they're going to explore rather than how to generate a chart. i forgot what 2013 was smart but articulate to this is when they started this is in chicago so develop. so wizard of oz is when you tell the participants that you're talking to a robot. but actually the researchers in the background. i'm doing the work as the robot so this is the way they could survey. users on what kinds of queries the participants with ask when creating a bit of visitation rights for what else does the users say that we could leverage. so that was the survey they did in 2020. kumar avenue generated or he like he created a prototype that classified what those are. the sexual advances that they were getting the other aunts other inches i mean sorry audrey you know other and sister. i guess so this study collected the davison and then kumar key label the dealership and create a polo-type on machine learning prototype. 2020 that tested the prototype they found that it was successful they didn't do a show in the analysis of it they just did like a little test. and then. yeah and then two years later we're supposed to do there they're still working on the same prototype and they just finished. and the baba 2020 that's me and i already gave you like the whole spiel with articulate. i know i said a lot but you haven't. do i need to like learning. right so i don't have much idea.. experience wasn't app. yeah you probably going to need to learn to listen. so you're going to be joining us in spring. i think you're going to have to learn some react to i'm i mean it doesn't hurt it's it's i think personally i think it's fun to do because you do like front-end stuff cuz he can actually see it and i'll be stuff is always in the background learning how to make website. such a beneficial thing to learn because you can like make quick prototypes and test your no. make things that you can show off to your employer later. oh okay yeah. are you going to take a break maybe. i don't know. you can go to. scrimba. i don't think you need to pay for it i think you could just like dog into this. cuz they actually they show you a video of everything that they're doing and then they have a little editor that you could use to practice doing exactly what they did and it's really nice or is really helpful to not only listen to what you're learning but actually to go through the motions then practice typing everything out. set 11 hours. dad like. 27 videos on building an airbnb experience clone. evelyn for building a meme generator 2. i'm moving on to the epscor project so on that project burger king. we're actually working on this called sage did he show you them all this. okay so sage. search for stands for smart amplified group environment it's a place or it's a software were a bunch of researchers can use in order to conduct data science together or collaborative feet. so you greeted with that homepage on the landing page and then there's no you know checks on this also create account and then you come to. this page which it's kind of resembles lock the review spot so you have your rooms on the left you can create a bunch of rooms. description. and then within the room you can create a bunch of boards. and i'm bored what can contain a bunch of apps. and these applications is are what were. northlake creating artwork reading the whole stage together but me and the visually i'm creating these little apps here for helping to create these little apps on helping researchers do collaborative work together so that we have the sticky note. this is useful for like brainstorming and i have a bunch of people in the room you say think of ways we could use an lp to talk to computers better and then they have a bunch of ideas $80 and no talk about it this is just like a little test app that we have counting this is like one of the first times that we created. we also have one for creating data visualizations so we have. like what i show you earlier and this is just a replica of this editor here. i just put into a little window and you can use the app toolbar. it's like crazy and it generates a charge for you. so i'm trying to do in the app store project is creating like these little tools like they go light to make it easy for researchers or do they are scientists to creatures easily and improved workflow of. free dating sites. you're doing this in typescript. yes this is in typescript. i mean it is it does resemble javascript are you doing differently for typescript is your defining your email java right. you just need to define the types of the. variables that you're using and if using an object have to create a whole. a construction for. define what properties are in your struts. screen sharing to a big thing that people ask for. twitter the job arab students i think they're 111 you're doing okay okay. yeah it's kind of boring cuz you don't really do anything. i guess you're doing more cuz you're an actual that you're getting paid. what classes are you taking. okay. and then which one is the ai is that with kim binsted. is it online what language does she teach. we are to present president of free papers during the whole semester. discussion no no programming. which is also a i. i'm taking. here is your first semester. papers too cuz i think. when you coming to the particular project they're still going to be the an lp experts there but. might be like a. maybe like a marriage of your an lp project and they're on the project and you guys can pray take this better system together or something. cuz there's a lot of things you could do differently or ways you could improve articulate. the carpenter has a shame you can do sentiment analysis on which types of participants with his always listening thing we found that there was in there was an issue because the participants had incomplete curry's so because it didn't hear the last word that you said so how do we feel in that last word. so who's all opportunities for you to do your interview stuff too. you can look at that future work on the air. architect i'm not sure if i have that feature work on my paper. it's only only 61 pages what is the double spaced. i have a future x feature work. i'm hoping to defend it by november 4th. i'll go home so if you leave in five yeah i got to finish this. everyday monday through friday i like today i might stay a little longer just because i'm a little behind. how old is he. earbuds review. 7.4 voltage with. 1000 ma. only around $50. yeah. 260. i can create a new family in a rescue situation if you're trying to get go through a bunch of. the dog to find the area for the persons that dusty smell and the robots all the rescue workers. a russian. all this time. make it a lot of paperwork yet.. water. custody papers on.. it'd be the perfect size for a mini the little dog tiny chihuahua that we had for a little while. chicken get in the tiny little derek. yeah my robot to create. what are the throw by capturing the vr headsets. what is. exactly. the camera is not well calculated. might be. or. where is mission point, georgia. does it mean to stitch together. dog sticks together how many points. so by default. well, 24 points. reduce or increase. the camera vibrates sold a lot of walking. the robots working. so i need the reviews as robot and the grandma has to take a look around. yeah. what about if you had like heaven i really fixed point at the thing. something that just went to one. every time you take us up to recalibrate that 120 or maybe i need one maybe two or three points. also. how's my research. what's the address. other problems. witcher timeline. i'm about to complete my ac in 3 years. or taking other types of approach only simulation. my approach verse in the bible when it comes to your work. you can use. are all the above text. and then. can you take the next step and whatever. and how much of it is like. yeah the reason why i used to. challenge. call my dad. i love you. note to the grating good feeling old television on the situation and throwing the robot remotely entire room projector. navigate search. waikiki. what's my name. i can create the corgi at this. is this answer the latency. of course. yeah. is there any way you can like me. started with micah. panoramic right before you start playing you just take a panoramic image. build off of that you're just adding to that start with a base image may become like. just trying to find ways to speed up. you're already using that i am at. making sweet sweetheart on the other thing that my friend wants me to work on. i can after that i can. not that. air combat maneuvering. basically like airplanes put this old parts on in the tracks as little bit better tracking than like your traditional transponder and so. it's all the other things like weapons systems and all that kind of stuff and so with that data. this is what my friend wants. something light like here in the er and you can like yeah that's kind of in frisco. can i have a really cool have a couple really good pictures of like the case in my display it and people. next generation. concrete concepts. revive tractor you can add in. he just magically strike out to element. hot medium download. yeah but it's like this is all supposed to be done like. you just basically you didn't need to process it in real time in terms of like you just have it all and you want to replay it so that would be like the system that my friend wants to. the scenario. one system outside of the yard that you can actually go in like manipulate things that maybe too important learning to compute you know like what kind of activities. connecting the dots together. be like you know choir. police outside. aircraft capabilities. they have exactly where it is called who was cover. i know that into the system. i was thinking. media wall. they have. you have a human. and then like take out the union. maybe.. no that's the future throws up there. chinese food stamp program. how to make working in that other scenario was just. everybody's in the sink. thresholds when it gets too far out. somebody has to jump. i'm working on trying to. me and rj and aaron. what kind of bugs fly. metrics for life. related projects for everybody was one of the suggestions was to try to. so we started playing compromised. call from the usac exchange database which has all of the posts and questions and everything. all the tags cuz people when they read it post felt i get 40 years ago they have a. he did zoom you said he was back. heater on friday. hi i'm actually. after i read some bunch of papers and soda. try to answer the question. he's kind of like not fair to just like. makeup app. i don't know if it's really. the last couple years. history with trigonometry. statistics in french. high school. but it is a. amazing progress. look at that. and there you are. the process of learning. what's the word. i can get some results. the blind leading the blind. i'd like to use. puerto rican buffet. hey since i do speech to text. and the first met the first step in a process. january 11th.. where's the closest sally's. ringo. why. strawberry hill prison. translate. that might be something interesting to know if possible that the steps that you would take would be different.. if i were to describe like. kourtney kardashian. there's a whiteboard. what you mean. i think i know. proximity between the language means this and robot. crl. the first believe we will talk dirty lyrics. but i guess i meant it all boiled down to me how. maybe it's better. take the password. i guess i'm old so i can't read my phone at like how old are you. you're too old. my dad my dad used to call dad's. your daddy doesn't bring up glasses restaurant that's my daddy the camera on the phone. will be there soon. types of stuff shows up it's almost 4. yeah my my neighbor and his birthday party it's 75 and like a big huge. is it all one. it's like really. 1985 up on the ladder it was that one but you type in your age and it shows you people your age typically achieve this or around you. i did not want to know that. urgent care. 25. going to be generation z. things other people, okay yeah. what is this not it this is the fans famous people. i like it's a french legionnaire know, i invented the first water bill turbine. age for cut off in canada for kids minor league hockey. march. ate before marching to gangnam turn 8 after march than you can cut off. i think here it's like you hold your kid back and sometimes even lie about their age for boys and then try to get the girls in the earlier before you say try to get the boys and later to school so they're bigger but yeah it's like a really common practice i guess but there is that cut off age and so like my kid happens to me like the oldest in his class right now cuz i think the september is to cut off. but that changed that my oldest son to come up with different when he was a kid. very competitive high schools and stuff that supposed to keep their kids back a year or two. just goes to show this whole worried that kids are going to be falling behind because of covid-19. once you get out of regular high school and go to college. ages. the generation of wave of new artists and. i don't know what the future ramifications. and they say no thanks. anyone can do it thanks so why would anyone need to be hot. hi google 12. there's some guy on youtube that don't forget this. this. don't know what sex is. really good at my language test because i would be. just by looking up all day. and then. how would you ever be able to find that path. or write some sentence that

i mean for the front end i'm not supposed to be here. and i mean that's an issue i get to add to get of i guess so that. i've been trying to just figure out how can i cry. color of that pool bar right now in the light mode off. maddie here. map to barnum follows around the apps kind of smart light. i want to know. hey we're kind of anything until i was like. does it fold anything home. play me. your owner. everybody left. i did my analysis wrong. near me. yes i just say hear you. i hear you this is wrong. forgot to count the number. back to square one. they read your analysis. they said it's okay. but i looked at it again. session 3. my name. 1756. 39. but i will check this s*** this is right. crispr that much okay now i got. xsport. total generator arts session toilet implicit. to change
